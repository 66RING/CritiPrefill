Appearing in a period when Letters were in an embryonic state and the population was massively illiterate, the Parthenon Litterario was the entity that effectively formed and consolidated the regional literary system, founding a renowned monthly magazine, stimulating the practice of reading and literary creation. It promoted the people's education with classes and other activities, organized regular soirées and conferences on literary and philosophical subjects, and a variety of other themes relevant to that historical moment, such as the moralization of customs, the national political model, the educational system, the definition of regional identity, the abolition of slavery, and the emancipation of women. The society was a main agent for the liberation of slaves in Porto Alegre and had an important influence in politics and in the dissemination of the republican ideal.Founded in 1868 by a group of around twenty people, the Parthenon Litterario grew to more than 140 effective members and a network of collaborators with more than 300 people, bringing together much of the intellectual elite of the state, with José Antônio do Vale Caldre e Fião and, above all, Apolinário Porto-Alegre as leaders. It was praised in its time as a source of important cultural and social advances, but some of its initiatives failed, and most of its specifically literary production is valued today mainly for its role of cultural dynamizer and structurer of the literary system, and for having laid the foundations of a literature of regionalist character, praising the figure of the gaucho, the folklore, the history of the state and the countryside scenery, within a romanticist framework. The cultural project of the Parthenon aggregated a generation of new talents, formed a new reading public, gave rise to the emergence of libraries, schools, associations, and literary publications in many cities of the state, and the society's activities offered a complete portrait of the Rio Grande do Sul intellectuality of the end of the 19th century.The society ceased its activities around 1888 and was reactivated in 1892, functioning precariously for a few more years. It was officially extinguished in 1899. Its history and contribution are still poorly known or little studied. In 1997, admirers of the entity's legacy re-founded it with the updated spelling Sociedade Partenon Literário, resuming the practice of regular sessions, promoting diversified activities, and launching several publications. History. The Sociedade Partenon Literário was founded on 18 June 1868, in Porto Alegre, in a period of social and political effervescence, with the Paraguay War in progress, republican ideas expanding, and a strong revival of the abolitionist movement. The local culture was still in its infancy, in a context that had been marked by a history of repeated military conflicts since the 18th century, by the main preoccupation with political and economic issues, poor education, and a chronic shortage of resources. Until the appearance of the Parthenon, few newspapers had been founded in the province, and even fewer were literary magazines, all of fleeting existence. Mainly through these rare vehicles, a meager literature of regional origin circulated, still very modest. However, a cultural movement was beginning and a significant group of intellectuals were active in Porto Alegre, Pelotas, and Rio Grande, the main urban centers.According to Regina Zilberman, \"if the manifestations that occurred in the thirties of the 19th century mark the emergence of literature in the south, its development occurred slowly, due to the more primitive circumstances of the environment. The cities were small, and the instruments of diffusion were reduced, adding to this the dependence on poetic guidelines coming from Rio de Janeiro. The solution found by the intellectuals was a kind of alliance under the aegis of a literary journal. Several periodicals were founded to shelter the writers; the first of them, O Guayba, which appeared in 1856, was short-lived.\". The creation of the Parthenon Litterario had the collaboration of approximately twenty founding members, but was centered on two figures: the physician and writer José Antônio do Vale Caldre e Fião and the young Apolinário José Gomes Porto-Alegre. Caldre e Fião, besides mentoring the new group and constantly supporting the initiative, lent his personal prestige, since he was a well-known author, being elected honorary president. Apolinário was fundamental for his dynamism and posture, and was the undisputed leader of the society. According to Luciana Boeira, his activity was so dominant that \"it is practically impossible to think about the institution without thinking about the action that Apolinário exercised for its maintenance.\" In the meetings that preceded the foundation, a provisional board was formed, composed of Vasco de Araújo e Silva (president), Antônio Ferreira Neves and Aurélio Veríssimo de Bittencourt (secretaries); Caldre e Fião, José Bernardino dos Santos, Manuel Pereira da Silva Ubatuba and Hilário Ribeiro de Andrade e Silva (statutes). The first effective president was Firmino Antônio de Araújo.Achilles Porto Alegre has recorded a memory of the founding times: \"Although the Paraguayan War had taken away the flower of our youth, we still managed to form a group of men of letters. Before this time, one or another writer, in the isolation of his office, without an exchange of ideas, gave himself to the culture of letters. Our intellectuals walked aimlessly, without a certain destination, distanced from each other as if crossing an immense desert, relying only on their value. [...] They were few, it is true, but each one of them gave at least one good example of courage. These were the pioneers who broke new ground, where later a temple was to be erected entirely dedicated to literature. Around Apolinário Porto-Alegre, a group of dreamers gathered, who would listen to him as an oracle. [...] In his residence at Rua Nova, nowadays General Andrade Neves, the preparatory sessions for the foundation of the Parthenon were held. The inauguration of the Parthenon took place in the same place where the Chapel of São José is, at Rua de Bragança.\". In the following year, the society launched the Revista Mensal da Sociedade Parthenon Litterario magazine, with an editorial board formed by Vasco de Araujo e Silva, Apolinário Porto Alegre, Lúcio Porto Alegre, Aurélio de Bittencourt, Menezes Paredes, and Hilário Ribeiro. Its foundation was met with some opposition and disbelief, and by reports from Apolinário, it only came to light after receiving the support of the reputed journalist, military, and former congressman Felipe Nery. The society faced difficulties to maintain itself, and in the early 1870s, it suffered the first of its several interruptions. Still, in its most active period, it had distribution agents in numerous inland cities, ensuring coverage of almost the entire Rio Grande do Sul territory, as well as being distributed in Rio de Janeiro and Mato Grosso.The emergence of the Parthenon is part of the tradition of the illustrated academies, which flourished in Europe since the 16th century and were imitated in Brazil. Like them, the Parthenon allowed the exchange of information, texts, and ideas among its members, who had different origins, occupations, and experiences, promoting the circulation of articles in its magazine and in different newspapers that traveled the most distant corners of Rio Grande do Sul, being not only a cultural and political forum but also an important space for socialization, at a time when such spaces were rare in the city. However, this same diversity, which added richness to its legacy, was the cause of polemics and internal friction.The society was interested in general education and set up a museum, a library, and a night school, which in 1873 taught classes of French, English, philosophy, rhetoric, history, geography, arithmetic, algebra, and geometry. The Parthenon propagated republican ideals and also promoted soirées, regular conferences, and debates on various themes, such as the Ragamuffin War, marriage, religion, education, morality, civic virtue, death penalty, and feminism, intervening, as Athos Damasceno said, \"in all sectors of social life, in whose development the most advanced postulations of the time would heat up. [...] In the heat of the debates, through the pen and the word, public opinion becomes aware and clarifies itself, in fact, and opportunely, of the problems that most affect it – the abolition of slavery, freedom of worship, the emancipation of women, the urgencies of popular instruction, political franchises.\". The Parthenon was also a form of decisive importance for the articulation, within a romantic framework, of the regionalist aesthetic, and for beginning the consolidation of the image of the gaucho, a character associated with championing activities, as a symbol of the people of the entire state and as a synthesis of their ideal moral, spiritual, and civic virtues. Múcio Teixeira left a succinct account of his activities: \"Besides the punctual publication of this magazine [the Revista Mensal], the Parthenon held bi-weekly sessions (one private to the members, the other open to their families), the dancing part beginning as soon as the literary soirée was over, which began with a lecture on a philosophical, artistic, historical or current affairs subject. Each one of us tried hard to catch the auditorium's attention with new ideas, crafted in a capricious style, achieving some real triumphs on the podium. We also put on stage, monthly, at the São Pedro Theater, dramas and original comedies by our confreres, with the roles played by some of them with the help of ladies from the best Porto Alegre society. And the material product of these shows was destined to the liberation of the captives, who received the letter of freedom in an open scene, among speeches and poetry, palms and flowers, applauses and blessings. [...]\"In the Parthenon library, the less fortunate members studied day and night, and there they found books at will, quill, paper, and ink for their literary essays, giving then to that ardent and courageous youth the greatest expansion to the propaganda of the new ideas, which soon found echoes in the voices of the students of the Military School of Porto Alegre, many of whom managed later to link their name to the most salient political facts that unfolded from the last years of the Empire until after the Republic was proclaimed.\". The society's trajectory was irregular and its internal history is barely known, but in 1872, as the minutes of this year show, one of the few well-documented, the institution was going through a serious crisis. A climate of discord had set in, and criticisms from the associates multiplied regarding various aspects. The librarian was accused of neglecting the care of the collection and of not having yet provided a catalog, the treasurer did not present the balance sheet, the commission in charge of revising the statutes was inert, there were outstanding debts, the sessions were impaired by poor organization, next year's elections were threatened, and some accused others of creating intrigue and deliberately spreading confusion. In December, members Aurélio de Bittencourt, João Câncio Gomes, and Múcio Teixeira, who had founded the Sociedade Ensaios Literários, were expelled. In the following year, whose minutes have also survived, show that the situation improved, and the main interest turned to reorganize the administration and the project of building its headquarters. In 1879, the Revista Mensal was restructured, being published as the Revista Contemporânea do Parthenon Litterario (Contemporary Magazine of the Parthenon Litterario) but it no longer had the vigor of before and was discontinued in September of the same year.Throughout its existence, the Parthenon functioned in several places, without ever having headquarters. According to Sérgio da Costa Franco, shortly after its foundation, the society lent its name to a real estate development in a suburb organized by Fernando dos Santos Pereira, who, in return, gave the Parthenon two plots of land for the construction of its headquarters. The subdivision was located on a high hill, and the building was to be an imitation of the Parthenon in Athens, also located on a hill. One of the plots was sold to pay for the construction. In November 1873, in a ceremony attended by João Pedro Carvalho de Morais, president of the province, and Dom Sebastião Dias Laranjeira, bishop of Porto Alegre, the cornerstone of the building was laid which, however, was never built, but was enough to baptize one of the city's current neighborhoods, the Parthenon. On that land today stands the Santo Antônio Church. In 1884, a plan to purchase the headquarters of the Sociedade Bailante Soirée Porto Alegrense was outlined, for 20 contos de réis, but the idea was not carried through. At this time the society was meeting in a house on Rua de Bragança.. Another attempt was made on 10 January 1885, when the cornerstone of a building located at Rua Riachuelo was laid, with the presence of Princess Isabel and Count D'Eu. In January 1886, a competition was announced for the project, which was to have a main façade imitating the Parthenon in Athens, a hall for sessions and soirées occupying the entire width of the building (and to be lavishly decorated), a room for the library, another for the museum, one more for classes and another for the practice of arts and crafts, as well as support facilities such as a room for the doorman, and storage rooms. The building would be of great proportions, crossing an entire block, with two façades, the main one on Rua Riachuelo and the back one on Rua Jerônimo Coelho. The author of the winning project would receive a 300 thousand réis prize. A budget of 30 contos de réis was available for the works. The chosen project was the design by engineer João Pünder, but as with the first project, the second was never realized.Meanwhile, since November of the previous year, the Parthenon had moved to a palace at Rua Sete de Setembro 49, reopening the People's School, which offered at the time the subjects of reading and analysis of the Portuguese language, calligraphy, geography, French, and linear drawing. However, in May 1886, there were news in the press expressing concerns about the fate of the society, there being no more record of sessions, until then regular. In May and June 1888, two sessions were announced, the last that the press records. In April 1892, the remaining members met at the headquarters of the Jornal do Comércio, under the leadership of Aquiles Porto-Alegre, the last president to reactivate the Parthenon, and a new deliberative assembly was called, which was held at the Theatro São Pedro, and a commission was chosen to revise the old statutes and arrange the rent of a building for its headquarters. A house at No. 10 Rua Nova was rented, meetings resumed, and on 14 September, a new board of directors was to be elected, but its records virtually disappeared. According to Benedito Saldanha, president of the contemporary reincarnation of the Parthenon, the activities ended definitively around 1896, and according to Sérgio da Costa Franco, \"the society was only officially dissolved in May 1899, according to a detailed report in the Jornal do Comércio on May 24 of that year. But since the previous decade, it had gone into hibernation.\"The reasons for this decline are unclear and may have been multiple. Internal frictions were a constant, and by the 1880s Caldre and Fião and other prominent partners had died. Authors such as Riopardense de Macedo, Cássia Silveira, and Carlos Baumgarten believe that dissent, depletion of financial resources, and the sheer aging of their proposal were major factors; for Guilhermino César the acidity of the criticism of the bourgeois, the nobility and the conservatives made by some members, ended up driving away those who were traditionalists and monarchists, causing fissures even among the republicans. Luis Augusto Fischer believes that other aspects of a changing political context may have been a decisive factor: \"I can give some hypotheses, which I would very much like to be able to prove by more documentary research, which we lack. For example, Apolinário and others from Parthenon were republicans, but they were not positivists. When the Rio-grandense Republican Party (PRR) started to act, especially with the newspaper A Federação, Apolinário was with them, but it seems to me that his temperament was democratic, deeply, while the dominant ideology among the PRR leaders was authoritarian. It is known that, in 1893, Apolinário's house was sacked, and it was necessary for him to flee to Uruguay. So, putting these isolated facts together, it seems clear to me that Apolinário had no space in the new order, or among the new republican generation, which would be a very valuable alliance.\"Its disappearance left a vacuum that was hard to be filled. In 1924, the critic João Pinto da Silva lamented \"The extinction of the benevolent society marked the return of Porto Alegre to the literary doldrums, from which until now we have not been able to emancipate ourselves.\" Around 1925, the land destined for the construction of its headquarters on the hill of Santo Antônio was donated to the Santa Casa de Misericórdia, erasing the last traces of the Parthenon.The Parthenon had over 150 members, mostly civil servants, with a significant number of professors, and included politicians, professionals, actors, and three religious people. Many of the members were associated with political parties and newspapers. More than 300 people were in some way connected to the society. Its honorary members, elected to lend prestige to the institution, were the president of the province Antônio da Costa Pinto e Silva, the bishop of Porto Alegre Sebastião Dias Laranjeira, and Manuel Marques de Sousa, count of Porto Alegre. Besides those already mentioned in the text, other prominent members were Alberto Coelho da Cunha (Vítor Valpírio), Lobo da Costa, Apelles Porto Alegre, Aurélio Veríssimo de Bittencourt, Luciana de Abreu, Pedro Antônio de Miranda, João Damasceno Vieira Fernandes Francisco Xavier da Cunha, Pedro Soledade, Augusto Rodrigues Totta, Joaquim Alves Torres, Dionísio Monteiro, José Carlos de Sousa Lobo, Silvino Vidal, Clarimundo Santos, Argemiro Galvão, Bernardo Taveira Júnior, Bibiano Francisco de Almeida, and Karl von Koseritz. Main areas of performance. Themes. The Parthenon Litterario dealt with a wide variety of polemic topics at the time. As Guilhermino César put it, \"its generous mentors wanted it spread to all domains of the intelligence, guiding letters and arts, mitigating social injustices, pointing directions to political organization.\" A sample of the breadth of the group's interests was offered by Luciana Boeira in her analysis of the most debated topics in the period 1872–1873:. Identification of the main representatives of the Brazilian nationality in the literary field.. Influence of the Pericles Century on literature and historiography.. Identification with the most brilliant period in the history of Rome.. Judgment of the merit of bloodshed in the struggle for freedom.. Judgment of the means employed to achieve the ends.. Identification of which of the forms of government of antiquity brought more prosperity, which most influenced modern times, and which was the ideal of freedom throughout history.. Judgment on the merits of the Paraguayan invasion of Rio Grande do Sul in 1865.. Comparative judgment of the merit of the life of the priest and the soldier.. Judgment on the value of the crusades to modern life.. Analysis of the institution of marriage from the Catholic viewpoint and judgment of the merit of the indissolubility of the bonds for the interests of modern society.. Comparative judgment of the nobility and generosity of male and female passions and feelings.. Identification of the best means of combating the influence of the Jesuits on education;. The debate about the thesis of the immortality of the soul.. Identification of the causes of the Ragamuffin War and judgment of its merit.. Gender equality and judgment of their merit.Overall, however, the society marked the history of Rio Grande do Sul primarily for its activity in the literary, educational, and abolitionist fields, for its interest in the appreciation of women and regionalism, as well as for its political influence. Literature. The Parthenon generation had been formed within a humanistic educational tradition, established in Brazil by the Jesuits and later by the regal classes. Although in the 1860s there was already a significant contingent of Protestants and a small minority of other faiths, the majority of the province's population was Catholic. The educational system, after the basic literacy phase, was divided into specific areas: Grammar (including Latin and Portuguese Literature), Rhetoric (History and Geography), Philosophy (Logic, Ethics, and Metaphysics), and Experimental Sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Natural history, Geometry, Drawing, Arithmetic, Trigonometry, and Algebra). Depending on the availability of masters, French and Greek classes could also be included in the curriculum. In these studies, there was a constant reference to authors of Greco-Roman antiquity, considered to be models, and for this reason, the literary production of the Parthenonists is rich in allusions to Classicism and is influenced by their oratory, literature, mythology, and their ethical and educational principles. Since Ancient Greece the cultivation of virtue was embedded in their educational system and considered fundamental to the formation of a \"perfect citizen\".. A more defined literary classicism appeared in Brazil at the end of the 18th century with the Neoclassicism writers, a school that left some marks in the first essays of southern literature, which only began in the 1830s, when the school was almost exhausted. The evolution was slow and local production would have to wait for the appearance of the Parthenon to establish itself definitively. Despite the strong classical heritage carried by its leading members, in terms of style, the Parthenon flourished primarily as a Romantic group, a movement that, in contrast to classical rationalism, restraint, impersonality, and universality, valued the individual, regional specificities, emotion, independence, and enthusiasm. It acted as a center of gravity around which a new interest in roots was articulated, by the origin myths, by local identity, history and its characteristic settings and types; structured new regionalist literature in the province and identified its place in the diversity of the Brazilian panorama; and set the direction for much of the intellectual, political and ideological activity of the society, with José de Alencar's work as one of the main literary models.Guilhermino César stated that through the pages of the society's magazine, it is possible to follow month by month the change in style and theme of the younger members of the entity, who are moving towards a nationalist and regionalist romanticism. In the 19th century, the view of history as a linear and cumulative process predominated, and many of the classical ideals were maintained through new readings. Guilhermino César mentioned that in their idealization of regional types, the Parthenonists placed them in a kind of Creole Arcadia.However, in the early nineteenth century, the doctrine of art for art's sake had not yet been defined, and the tendency was to see literature not only as leisure but also as a social function. This opinion was still current at the end of the century, as exemplified by the words of the reputed writer, Gonçalves de Magalhães, one of the founders of national Romanticism, who stated in 1865: \"The literature of a people is the development of what it has of the most sublime in ideas, of most philosophical in thought, of most heroic in morals, and most beautiful in nature.\" This idealism did not prevent that from the 1850s, imitating the national example, and popular literature of quick consumption began to proliferate in the province, mainly through the press.Amid a growing influx of imported texts, it was a concern of the Parthenon to encourage the local production of literature, but, advocating a project of regeneration of civilization, the educational and moralizing function of literature was always strongly emphasized. Even works by famous writers were discouraged if they could harm the ethics and good manners of the population, and moral education was among the main interests of the members. Caldre and Fião, for example, mentioned that \"the pleasant should come after the useful and this after the necessary.\" The popular taste had a considerable space among the Parthenonists, and many of the texts published in their journal were mild and accessible, aimed especially at the female public, although the works were selected by the criteria of morality and educational value. Even though within the Parthenon's program there was a strong concern to establish aesthetic refinement as a central element of good literature, better delimiting its field of action and its character, to perform its task, the literate could not only know how to write well but should follow a strict code of ethics, assuming a \"mission\" that was often compared to the priesthood or the career of arms, and should be a polymath, mastering broad knowledge in a variety of subjects, keeping in force many of the ideals of the \"man of letters\" that had been formulated since the previous century.The main Parthenonists also intended to keep literature away from politics, claiming that it could spoil its purity, but in practice this did not occur, coming into direct conflict with their project of changing the directions of the history, culture, and society of Rio Grande do Sul through literature, producing works of a strong ideological and politicized nature, and establishing alliances with parties and politicians for their initiatives to be carried out.The Parthenon played a fundamental role in the aesthetic organization and diversification of the literary theme, as well as in the valorization of the literate as a professional, promoting the passage from a system of dispersive \"literary manifestations\" to the formation of a \"literature\", as a continuous and organized production of works capable of being identified as part of a movement with its own identity and a defined function. For this organizing and valuing role, and for the consistency and long duration of its project, the society was recognized by the consensus of historians as the one responsible for the foundation of a literary system in the province, with the Revista Mensal as its main instrument. Revista Mensal. The Revista Mensal (Monthly Magazine) of the Parthenon Litterario Society was published from March 1869 to September 1879, with some interruptions. In each issue one of the members of the commission took on the role of editor-in-chief, and was responsible for organizing the volume and writing an editorial, the \"Monthly Chronicle\", which presented a report of the society's activities or brought relevant news from the province and beyond, being valuable historical documents. The magazine was printed at the printers of the Jornal do Comércio. Athos Damasceno mentions that it likely had a free distribution, but in an 1875 issue a subscription fee appears. The charging might have become a necessity at a certain point.The magazine did not have the expected repercussion at its launch, but soon was regularly praised in the press for the benefits it had been bringing to the cultural world and the society of the province. A survey conducted by Pedro Leite Villas Boas identified a total of 78 collaborators, eight of them women. However, the value of these individual contributions was not homogeneous, and on the whole, their specifically literary value was considered low by Moysés Vellinho, who stated, \"Their pages, crusted with a rhetoric that for us has completely lost its sense and taste, retain a purely historical interest,\" noting that \"in their time they played a considerable function, a function that cannot fail to be taken into account in the inventory of our literary evolution.\" Athos Damasceno agreed, analyzing that \"really, although of little or no value for letters, these pages, however, vividly translate the aspirations of the time and attest to the warmth, the commitment with which here was then trying to respond to the appeals of the historical moment, expressively in tune with the spirit of renewal of customs, institutions, and ideas already in full bloom in other cultural areas of Brazil.\"The magazine contained literary criticism, commentaries, editorials, and studies on Rio Grande do Sul's history and culture. Speeches given in society were then transcribed for the magazine, in addition to short stories, narratives, plays, and poetry. The longer texts were divided into several parts and published over several issues. According to Alexandre Lazzari, \"in their majority, the writers who contributed to the Parthenon magazine preferred to write short stories and poems about the feelings and customs of the urban society, with special concern for the moral education of the family girls.\" Almost every issue featured a biography of an illustrious personage, accompanied by a portrait, which was presented as a model of virtue that the youth should imitate. Those chosen were generally educated men, military men, politicians, and professors from the recent past, who had not distinguished themselves by radical ideological or party adherences, demonstrating the society's interest in reaching the widest possible public. In an editorial, Caldre e Fião emphasized the function of these texts: \"It is more useful, I say again, for us to engrave virtue, glory, heroism upon bronze or marble, or in these pages which are to be written, for the lesson of youth, for the models of generations to come, than to narrate the easy triumphs of happy minds who know how to tell us in the hours of distraction with beauty and grace, how beautiful and graceful is the nature of our pays, our sun, our moon, and the sweet waters that quench us and the forests that shade us and generate melancholy but intoxicating schisms in our soul.\". Literary criticism was one of the relevant areas of activity of the Revista Mensal, aiming to form the taste of the public. This criticism was not restricted to purely literary aspects, as it also analyzed the moral quality of the productions since the ethical and civic education of the population was among the main concerns of the Parthenon. This activity as arbiters of taste and education extended to the theater, considered a moral school. Several members of the Parthenon ventured into the creation of dramaturgy, with works staged and published in the Revista Mensal. Although the Theatro São Pedro was already functioning and there was a theatrical tradition in the city, the Parthenonists were concerned about the low level of the works presented, which often had a circus character or were popular comedies. In the analysis of Cássia Silveira, \"[The theater] had the advantage of presenting to the spectators, theoretically, scenes from the lives of ordinary people and, emphasizing the naturalness of the staging. It also tried to show the Porto Alegre public the most appropriate behavior, gestures, dress, and language for each situation. Thus, the theater was an art form very much in tune with the kind of exemplary pedagogy of which the Parthenon was adept [...] The texts about theater, in general, established a hierarchy between a superior taste, patriotic and in harmony with civilization, and another \"perverted\", that preferred the little horses and the comic sketches. The superior taste would be linked to an equally superior morality, and should appreciate a picture of clean customs.\". It was a publication that reflected the heterogeneous composition of society and the different degrees of preparation of its members, in which there were conservatives and liberals, monarchists and republicans, Catholics and Masons, romanticists and classicists, spiritualists and materialists, rationalists, evolutionists, scholastics and free thinkers. The magazine was the main publication of literary character in Rio Grande do Sul in the 19th century and one of the main vehicles of consecration for new authors. Its greatest contributions to the southern literary and cultural universe were the structuring of the regional literary system, the consolidation of literary criticism as a specific professional activity, autonomous and distinct from journalism. The publication has also been a vehicle for the dissemination of regionalist literature, and remained the best source for the study of the state's intellectuality of the late nineteenth century. For Guilhermino César, the magazine had the merit of constituting a regular and consistent space for the continued writing of literature that organizes itself thematically and aesthetically, and was a vehicle of central importance for the rescue of local traditions. In Vinícius Estima's synthesis: \"Continuing the task initiated by its predecessors O Guayba (1856) and Arcádia (1867), the magazine not only expanded the field of action of the literary press in the south but also began to promote the decentralization and unification of literature, to the extent that its circulation reached the various localities of the province. More than promoting the dissemination of authors and works, publishing short stories, novels, poetry, and other productions of those who, over the years, would establish themselves as the great intellectual mentors of the state, the wide dissemination of the magazine stimulates the constitution of a faithful and active reading public, formed both by collaborators and members of the institution itself, and by the creators of other groups and press vehicles that are formed from its influence.\"According to some authors, such as Maria Eunice Moreira and Carlos Baumgarten, a divergence among members of the Parthenon would have led to the emergence of the journal Murmúrios do Guaíba, of ephemeral duration. For Mauro Póvoas, it was created to fill the vacuum left by the temporary interruption of the Revista Mensal in December 1869, both using identical structures in literary dissemination. Athos Damasceno lamented the brevity of its existence, comparing it in quality to the Revista Mensal. Politics, aesthetics, and regionalism. There was little unity of political purpose among the Parthenonists, but most were somewhat politicized and many were affiliated or had clear party connections. Some of their main representatives were Republicans, especially Apolinário Porto-Alegre, who wielded powerful influence over the group and would later be one of the founders of the Partido Republicano Rio-Grandense. Others, although coming from the ranks of the Liberal Party, such as Caldre and Fião, were in chorus with the Republicans in their complaints against the centralizing policy of the Imperial Government. The province had a militaristic and libertarian tradition, which had reached a climax in the Ragamuffin War (1835–1845), which arose from demands for greater autonomy and economic pressures, but soon evolved as a separatist movement, founding in part of the province an ephemeral independent republic. The bloody conflict was repressed by the Imperial Government, but it reached a conciliatory solution, reintegrating the dissidents into the constituted order. Given this, for decades the separatist and republican element was obscured in the official discourse of Rio Grande do Sul, but these associations were emphasized again during the flourishing of the Parthenon Litterario. Several factors intertwined for this phenomenon to occur. In the 1870s, the Republican movement had gained much momentum in Brazil, and in Rio Grande do Sul the revolution began to undergo positive re-readings, praising the courage of its promoters, now seen as heroes of the cause of freedom, in opposition to the monarchy, understood as a source of oppression.Many of the Parthenonists were egresses of the extinct Historical and Geographical Institute of the province of São Pedro (IHGPSP), a branch of the Brazilian Historical and Geographical Institute, which had disappeared before the foundation of Parthenon. In that institution, the main interests were the articulation of regional historiography and its insertion in national historiography. Caldre e Fião, when the official orator of the IHGPSP, stated that the writing of history was the best way to collaborate in the progress of the nation, because it integrated in a single discipline all aspects of national life, allowing to form a coherent idea of its \"civilizatory march\", to identify its sources, traits and common goals and thus define its true identity. It was implicit in the IHGPSP program, as its contribution to the historiography of Brazil, to value the local element, and it planned to publish a series of biographies of Rio Grande do Sul's leaders, founding a gallery of local heroes, shown to the public as examples of civic virtue and moral greatness. The idea, however, did not succeed, due to the institute's early demise. Although the Parthenon's orientation was much more literary than scientific, the interest in history remained strong, the ideology of the IHGPSP was largely continued, and the project of the gallery of heroes materialized, as shown in the pages of the Revista Mensal.. In this way, the context was established for the definition of the state's sociocultural identity, still embryonic and disarticulated, and for the formation of a literature of regionalist character, called gauchesca, whose first exponents are found among the members of the Parthenon, who divulge their writings in the Revista Mensal and publish independent works. The regionalist theme was not a novelty and had been in gestation for some time, although dispersed and inconsistent, but it was through Parthenon that regionalism would be converted into a definite program and would be cultivated literarily in a systematic way.In this process, the image of the native to Rio Grande do Sul (gaúcho), was mythified as a synthesis of ideal values collected from the Ragamuffin imaginary and the folklore surrounding the Indians and the first settlers: independence, bravery, virility, honesty, and the alleged warrior and heroic character of the people was revered and emphasized to place them as the natural defender of the southern frontier of the Empire. As Luis Fernando Beneduzi stated, for them, the gaucho was \"a kind of superman, invincible, indomitable, and who was always ready to fight to the last drop of blood for the just causes.\" Moreover, more than being concerned with the discovery and valorization of the originality of the local culture, there was a current that conceived the province as differentiated from the rest of Brazil, and therefore deserving of a literature that represented and distinguished it properly. In Guilhermino César's words: \"Through its first editors [of the Revista Mensal], the new current was attracted, above all, by the gaucho past, seeking to revive the guasca largado, the free man of the first times of the conquest, the rebels of 1835. [...] The imagination of Apolinário, Taveira Júnior, Múcio Teixeira, Caldre and Fião, Lobo da Costa, all those who had something to say about the people of the Pampeña, their sorrows, and joys, was directed to the frontier region, to its territory bathed in blood and heroic deeds. The ranch cowboy, heir of the \"monarch of the coxilhas\", the hero of the early days, the cowboy who was already a faded image of the other's freedom and daring, came to represent the writers, through the effect of a forgivable transposition, the brio, the haughtiness, the personal courage of the old lord of the savannahs. He occupied here the place which had fallen to the Indian and the Black in the liberal literature which since Macedo had bored the letters of the center and north of the country.\". Contributing to this was a late flourishing in the south of literary Romanticism, a movement that had among its objectives to value the picturesque, the local, and the originality of regional and national traditions and identities, generally idealizing its characters. In the Parthenonist environment, regionalism was understood as a variant of the nationalism cultivated by Romantics in other parts of Brazil and as a path to achieving the autonomy they desired for the letters of the province. According to Flávio Loureiro Chaves, the emergence of regionalism in Rio Grande do Sul is due in part to the typically romantic interest in folklore, history, and linguistic research, problematizing the debate on nationalism and leading \"to the conscious and programmatic valorization of the regional\". For Regina Zilberman, the Parthenonists \"accomplish in a finished way the major purpose of Brazilian Romanticism, namely, the poetic arrangement of the national desire to see itself reproduced in literature.\" In Carine Daniel's words, \"Gaucho Romanticism is a kind of compromise between the mythical and the documentary. On the observed reality, landscape, types, customs, is invested the mythical visualization that transposes it to the plane of ideality.\"In the pages of Revista Mensal appeared crônicas, poems, short stories, and novellas such as Serões de um Tropeiro by Bernardino dos Santos; Tapera, Feitiços duns Beijus, and O Vaqueano by Apolinário Porto-Alegre; A Filha do Capataz and Um Farrapo não se Rende by Vítor Valpírio; Pampeiro by Augusto Totta; and Flores do Pampa by Múcio Teixeira. However, critics like Athos Damasceno, Moysés Vellinho, Augusto Meyer, and Flávio Loureiro Chaves consider that in this phase the authors superficially appropriated a scenario and its characteristic types, undoubtedly giving a strong local flavor to their writings, but without transforming in depth the framework of literary forms and aesthetics of the period, still very dependent on imported models, being in this sense more traditionalist than revolutionary. Apolinário Porto Alegre himself would later recognize this condition: \"To be worthy of America, I would have to restart all my studies and redo them from the ridge to the foundations, because I had concluded that I was nothing but a mannequin of Europe.\"Besides having a strong popular appeal, with elements that could be identified with the common reader, romanticized regionalism served the interests of the dominant political class and the elite of the large estancieros, interconnecting with the issue of consolidating the identity of the Rio Grande do Sul, whose strengthening would help the political projection of the province on the national scene, and whose ideals of freedom and autonomy were in line with the republican current. In Juarez Fuão's interpretation, the literary romanticization of the gauchesca theme also had the advantage of broadening the scope of the primitive representations of the gaucho found among the first local historians, such as Cezimbra Jacques and Alfredo Varela, which had focused on scientific and historical aspects. With the transposition of local motifs to literature, where scientific truth is relativized, their message became more independent and more convincing. According to Tau Golin, the association between the power elite and the intellectual elite stimulated an exchange of favors: the intellectuals made the apology for the manly, warlike, and patriotic values of which the powerful thought themselves to be the possessors and guardians, and in return, they received support, prestige, and jobs in the civil service. Education and morality. At the time of the Parthenon, education in the province was poorly organized and of low quality, even in the capital there was a context of precariousness recognized by the government. The first public classes in Porto Alegre were founded in 1820 with three teachers. By 1832, nine public elementary schools had been created, but only one was functioning. In the 1850s, a high school was founded in the capital, but it could not meet the demand and the quality necessary. Some private schools functioned, but also with poor results, and the complaints continued in the press and in the tribunes of the Provincial Assembly. To achieve a higher education, it was necessary to go to the academies in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, or abroad, accessible only to the wealthy families. In 1872, 75.94% of the Rio Grande do Sul population was illiterate, and the following year the Porto Alegre lyceum closed its doors.. The Parthenon sought to expand the culture of the province by supporting or sponsoring several elementary and secondary schools in Porto Alegre, and offering night courses for adults. It created a library with 6 thousand volumes of important works, and a museum, one of the first in the province, with a collection of more than 4 thousand items divided into the sections of Mineralogy, Archaeology, Numismatics, Botany and Zoology. The Parthenon had the intention of founding an academy (university), which if it had materialized would have been the first in the province. It also encouraged the creation of libraries in several municipalities to expand the reading public. The society also developed plans for women's education on a large scale, which also did not materialize. Many of the Parthenon members were teachers and some founded prestigious schools, such as the Porto-Alegre brothers, Hilário Ribeiro, Vasco de Araújo, and Bibiano Francisco de Almeida.In the view of the Parthenonists, providing good role models was one of the most important functions of literature. For some, religion could also be a good teacher, but there were divergent opinions about its role and usefulness, and the moral reputation of the Rio Grande do Sul's Catholic clergy of the time, in general, was low. Despite this concern, directed mainly at youth, in the ideology propagandized by the Parthenon and supported by the political and economic elites, Rio Grande do Sul was considered to be a granary of virtue and honor, and it was up to the young to imitate the example of the elders and the heroes.A direct consequence of the perception of provincial literature as precarious and incipient, and of reading as dependent on outside authors, was the emphasis on autochthonous creation. Although reading the works of famous literati and philosophers from Brazil and abroad was encouraged, it was desired to make literary creation a routine practice in Rio Grande do Sul, which linked directly to the encouragement given to the education of the people as the basis on which that routine could be built.. The Parthenon's educational and civilizing goals were embedded in the very name of the society: The Parthenon, dedicated to the goddess Athena, is the name of the main building of the Acropolis of Athens, a city traditionally consecrated as one of the cradles of Western civilization. According to Schnorr & Rosa, \"relating a literary association to a divinity recognized for its wisdom, intelligence, and prudence seems to do justice to the Parthenonists' project of fighting against the ignorance of the Rio Grande do Sul population, mostly composed of illiterate individuals. They tried to equate bravery in the military arts with the achievements of intellectual struggle, in a land that had neither libraries nor good schools (and no higher education), where prowess in arms and political tribunes had always won the highest praise. The Revista Mensal had many editorials and articles following the romantic taste of the time and the visions of its founders. An example of this discourse appears in the presentation of the Parthenon Program, written by Apolinário Porto-Alegre and published in the first issue of the magazine, from which some excerpts follow: \"June 18, 1868, marked a great epoch. A monument was erected. The foundations were laid under the auspices of a horrendous storm. It seemed that earth and heaven conspired against an idea in its sublime realization. There was everything to overcome, everything to create, without the flattering smile of hope, without the shimmering of the dawn, without a word of encouragement! The Alvans of the Parthenon were apostles of a belief, as were Cephas and Paul; they both had the same moral energy. The cult of letters is also a religion, and like every religion, it is not without a coliseum of martyrdom, a crown of thorns, and an apotheosis on the pencil that covers it. June 18th opened the literary cycle in the province, which until then, had not been able to gather a nucleus where the civilizing light could focus on the true, the good, and the beautiful.\" Feminism. The integration of women into social life was one of the concerns of the Parthenon from the very beginning. At that time, the role of women was confined to the domestic sphere. They had little space in cultural activities; it was admissible for them to become teachers, and to possess artistic talents, such as singing and piano playing, taken as a sign of virtue and good education, but it was above all seen as a social ornament, suitable only for display in semi-public soirées. There was a large number of women engaged in labor and servile work, who also had little voice, but their participation in politics and intellectual activities was always discouraged. They were believed to have a passionate and sentimental nature, their sexuality was feared to escape control, and they should renounce any pretense of command. Women did not vote, and even the office of teaching, though encouraged as honorable and natural to women, did not escape prejudice. As Regina Zilberman put it, \"Assigning women to the teaching profession solved several problems: it justified the need to educate women; it solved the problem of the lack of manpower for teaching, a profession little sought after because it was poorly paid; there was no need to improve wages because women's wages should not be higher than men's. These reasons were covered by others, ideological in nature: The teacher was idealized, calling her a \"mother\" and thus suggesting that, in teaching, she remained faithful to her maternal nature; the professional element of teaching was denied because the classroom became a second home; teaching would not be a problem, because it was not work, but an extension of domestic chores, which held back the eventual emancipatory tendency that this activity might contain and did not contradict the sexist nature of Brazilian patriarchal society; and the woman-wife-mother association remained untouched, and also idealized, even when she was outside the home, earning the modest daily bread.\". The Parthenonists did not have a consensual position on the feminine question, but in general recognized that women were abandoned and that their potential in the project of nation building was poorly used, believing that their poor participation in the community was due above all to a deficient education, focused only on domestic chores. To remedy this situation, following the position of other thinkers of the time, they proposed that an improved education would \"refine their spirits\" and direct their attention to moral and elevated themes, and would give them more conditions to assist their husbands, better prepare their children and form patriotic citizens dedicated to public interests. However, they still conceived the woman essentially as destined to the home and needing constant male guidance. An article by Apolinário Porto-Alegre in the Revista Mensal is an example of the male opinion about women in the late 19th century, when he invited them to read the magazine and enjoy the texts aimed at them: \"Yes, the magazine is for you sublime creatures, sworn enemies of the dry formulas of science and the algebra of principles. [Daughters of the poetic delight of God, passionate lovers by instinct and affinity of flowers, you want to see them bloom even in style. [...] When you want to understand the supreme architect of the world, it is certainly not in the wise dissertations of the doctors of the Church, nor in the muscular argument of philosophy, it is in the dawn that dawns, in the meadow that blooms and in the sky that glitters, it is rather in the melancholy melodies of Lamartine or Chateaubriand.\". At least twelve women are recorded participating in the Parthenon's activities, among them Luísa de Azambuja, Amália dos Passos Figueroa and Revocata Heloísa de Melo, but the greatest exponent was Luciana de Abreu, who was reputed and protected by Caldre and Fião. She was the first woman to be admitted into a literary society in Brazil, and the first who went up on a public tribune to express her ideas. Orphaned, adopted by a humble family, and dedicated intensely to study, she became a poet, an orator, and a public teacher, being admired. She was in line with the Parthenonists' general educational proposal but went beyond it. She advocated the perfect equality of the genders in their capacities of intelligence and sensitivity, did not accept the submissive and domestic role reserved for them, complained about the inherent injustice of differential treatment, and advocated that women should be recognized for their leadership capacity and that they had the right to pursue higher education and freely govern their own lives by choosing the professions to which they felt inclined. Her speeches made a lively impression, according to reports of the time they resonated throughout the city.However, the feminism of the Parthenonists ceased, and most of them were not willing to grant women such independence. Exceptions to this position were Bernardino dos Santos, who supported the full equalization between the genders, and in part Caldre e Fião, who proposed a broader educational model, having presented in 1854 to the Provincial Assembly a complete project for women's education where each woman would receive an education appropriate to her social position, and which included the creation of rural schools for poor girls where they would learn various trades, however the project was not adopted.According to Cássia Silveira, after the initial enthusiasm, the Parthenonists ended up having disagreements about how to interpret Luciana's discourse, and in the end, her ideas and projects were overshadowed and forgotten, with the patriarchal model upheld by the majority, which included Apolinário, the influential leader of the group. Her example, however, marked the local culture, and today she is remembered as one of the pioneers of feminism in Rio Grande do Sul. Abolitionism. The Parthenon saw slavery as a crime against humanity and as a factor of delay in the civilizing process, proposing an economic-social model based on free labor and the education of former slaves. The society actively participated in the abolitionist movement, often using this banner as a pretext to attack the monarchy and its institutions, considered obsolete by them. In 1869, claiming to be inspired by the activities of the Parthenon, the Liberal Directory and the Count of Porto Alegre created the Liberating Society, which managed to raise funds for the liberation of at least 50 enslaved children. In September 1883, two members of the Parthenon, Joaquim de Salles Torres Homem and Júlio César Leal, who were members of the Abolitionist Section, founded a parallel entity, the Abolitionist Center of Porto Alegre, under the presidency of Colonel Joaquim Pedro Salgado, and took the lead in the campaign to free the slaves in the city. All political parties and the City Council supported the idea. They published articles in the press and organized the so-called \"abolitionist journey\", which took place between 12 and 18 August 1884, when commissions were created to go around the districts and suburbs of the capital persuading slave owners to free their slaves. The Abolitionist Center and the Chamber organized festivities between 6 and 8 September, with public ceremonies attended by the highest state and municipal authorities, civic parades, and kermesses aimed at raising funds.However, there were serious disagreements between liberals, conservatives, and republicans on how liberation should be conducted, and the controversy extended into the Parthenon, but there was a general concern that without control the freedmen would fall into vagrancy and crime. Some members of the Parthenon, such as Alberto Coelho da Cunha and Apolinário Porto-Alegre, had a clear view on the matter, denouncing the prejudice and the cruel treatment blacks received, but in that context, the dominant tendency was to create a mechanism of conditional freedom, where freedmen would be obliged to render services to their former masters for up to seven years, although they were nominally free, because, as the province president Rodrigo de Azambuja Vilanova stated, \"the great majority of freedmen will prefer to accompany their former benefactors, as in Rio Grande do Sul slavery was always a family institution, with the slave participating in all the advantages of the masters, to whom they must be tied today by the bonds of gratitude, and whose intelligence and experience they cannot do without. As a result of the campaign, all the slaves in the city were freed in September 1884, four years before the signing of the Lei Áurea. Legacy. It is a consensus among historians that the founding of the Parthenon constituted a watershed in the literary-cultural field of Rio Grande do Sul, and that its activity was of great importance in its time, but this importance lies mainly in the foundation of literature of regionalist character and its generic role of cultural dynamizers, since the fruits of its specifically literary production, in aesthetic and artistic terms, even if following trends of the time, have been considered poor, with few exceptions. The Parthenon Literário was also at the forefront of the state abolitionist movement, carried out the relevant political and educational activity, and was a pioneer in the process of gender equalization by admitting and honoring women, albeit in a limited way.For Athos Damasceno, the society promoted \"the disentanglement of the entire institutional apparatus, for the benefit of Rio Grande do Sul's progress. And there we find the first signs of this new phase of our history\"; \"and not only will it act strongly in our midst, intervening in all spheres of the state's life, as it will be the starting point, the origin of new literary societies that, during the last thirty years of the century will be built, transmitting to each other the responsibilities of processing our culture, its meaning and its objectives\". For Luciana Boeira it was \"the most successful case of cultural association in Rio Grande do Sul in the 19th century\"; according to Camila Vellinho, \"no similar society had, until then, in any cultural center of the country, the importance or the duration of the Parthenon. Before the Academia Brasileira de Letras (\"Brazilian Letter Society\"), founded much later, the Literary Partenon was, without a doubt, the association that showed more vitality in the general framework of Brazilian literature\"; for Flávio Loureiro Chaves its appearance was \"a decisive landmark in the history of literature in Rio Grande do Sul\", the same opinion by Regina Zilberman: \"The effective beginning of the literature in Rio Grande do Sul coincides with the performance of those writers who took part in this association. [...] It is with the members of the Literary Partenon that the effort in favor of the strengthening of local literature, through the concretization of a circuit of production and consumption of works, is more successful.\" In Maria Eunice Moreira's synthesis, \"The proposition of effective mechanisms to achieve its goals, the discovery and dissemination of authors and works, the formation of a reading public not only in the capital, but also in the interior, associated with its long duration, gave the society a mythical role in the history of the Rio Grande do Sul literature. United by the republican ideals and agglutinated by common political principles, namely the republic and the abolition of slavery, the generation of the Literary Partenon, as this group of intellectuals became known, provoked a true revolution in a Province generally more shaken by war than by letters. The Literary Parthenon assumes a special function, for its members are men engaged with the political ideals of the ruling class of Rio Grande do Sul and, at the same time, it is still this group that produces and divulges the literary material capable of representing and conforming the yearnings of the community in which it is inserted. By organizing literary life in the extreme of Brazil, the Parthenonists collaborated to sustain the republican elite in power: artists in creation, politicians in ideology, but, above all, builders of the Rio Grande do Sul society, the Literary Partenon combined literary and political purposes, resulting in its importance for the understanding of a historical period and for the study of the birth of literature in the state. To read the narratives written by these early writers is, therefore, to read the initial pages of the formation of the state and the genesis of its literary process.\" Re-foundation. After 112 years, the Sociedade Parthenon Literário restarted its activities on 10 July 1997, from a group of intellectuals interested in continuing the works, with the encouragement of Serafim de Lima Filho, Cláudio Pinto de Sá, and Frei Aquylles Chiapin. The struggle for its headquarters continues, and it currently maintains an administrative office on Plácido de Castro Street; meetings are held monthly at the Legislative Assembly.Legally, however, although the society is said to have restarted its activities in 1997, it was technically a re-founding. Like the old partners, the current ones are not bound or subordinated to any closed type of literature or artistic expression. They include jurists, poets, prose writers, visual artists, journalists, musicians, and actors. In 2016 it had 195 members. Lectures, informal conversations, soirées, seminars, and exhibitions are scheduled, and it also maintains several publications. The new Partenon maintains a strong connection with the old entity, but is not exclusively memorialistic and has established a commitment to the present and the future. According to president Benedito Saldanha, \"the great cause of today's Partenon is the encouragement of reading and the formation of readers.\" The entity has already launched several collections, in addition to the traditional Revista (\"Magazine\") do Partenon Literário, now in book format. They are:. Collection of the Literary Partenon, with commemorative editions;. Collection of Authors Gathered, an anthology for members and non-members, aimed at valorizing emerging talents;. Prata da Casa Collection, gathering works by members;. Our Letters Collection, an anthology for members;. Juridical Letters Collection;. Parthenon Lectures Collection;. Archive and History Collection, institutional anthologies to record the actions and acts of each administration;. Special Edition Collection, covering productions created for ephemerides.In 2005, the society was declared of public utility by the Municipal Chamber of Porto Alegre, and in 2008 the State Government enacted a law declaring it a State Historical and Cultural Heritage Site. In 2010, the City Council of Porto Alegre awarded it the Diploma Honra ao Mérito, honoring its role as a pioneering institution of Rio Grande do Sul literature and a landmark of the state's cultural formation. In 2016, on the initiative of the Círculo de Pesquisas Literárias and with the support of the Coordenação da Memória Cultural da Prefeitura de Porto Alegre, a replica of the plaque commemorating the centennial of its foundation was installed in Praça da Matriz. In 2018, in the celebrations of its 150th anniversary, it received homage from the Plenary of the Federal Senate. \n\n### Passage 2\n\n Aeronautics. The DRDO is responsible for the ongoing Light Combat Aircraft. The LCA is intended to provide the Indian Air Force with a modern, fly by wire, multi-role fighter, as well as develop the aviation industry in India. The LCA programme has allowed DRDO to progress substantially in the fields of avionics, flight control systems, aircraft propulsion and composite structures, along with aircraft design and development.The DRDO provided key avionics for the Sukhoi Su-30MKI programme under the \"Vetrivel\" programme. Systems developed by DRDO include radar warning receivers, radar and display computers. DRDO's radar computers, manufactured by HAL are also being fitted into Malaysian Su-30s.. The DRDO is part of the Indian Air Force's upgrade programmes for its Sepecat Jaguar combat aircraft, along with the manufacturer Hindustan Aeronautics Limited. DRDO and HAL have been responsible for the system design and integration of these upgrades, which combine indigenously developed systems along with imported ones. DRDO contributed subsystems like the Tarang radar warning receiver, Tempest jammer, core avionics computers, brake parachutes, cockpit instrumentation and displays.. HAL AMCA: Aeronautical Development Agency of DRDO is responsible for the design and development of the fifth-generation aircraft. In 2015, 700 ADA employees were working on the project along with 2,000 employees of DRDO.. Avatar is a concept study for a robotic single-stage reusable spaceplane capable of horizontal takeoff and landing. The mission concept is for low cost military and commercial satellite space launches. Electronic countermeasure. Defence Laboratory Jodhpur in collaboration with High Energy Materials Research Laboratory developed an improved chaff material and chaff cartridge-118/I for the Indian Air Force to protect Indian military aircraft from radar jamming and deception. Other Hindustan Aeronautics programmes. Apart from the aforementioned upgrades, DRDO has also assisted Hindustan Aeronautics with its programmes. These include the HAL Dhruv helicopter and the HAL HJT-36. Over a hundred LRU (Line Replaceable Unit)'s in the HJT-36 have come directly from the LCA programme. Other duties have included assisting the Indian Air Force with indigenisation of spares and equipment. These include both mandatory as well as other items. Unmanned aerial vehicles. The DRDO has also developed two unmanned aerial vehicles – the Nishant tactical UAV and the Lakshya (Target). Pilotless Target Aircraft (PTA). The Lakshya PTA has been ordered by all three services for their gunnery target training requirements. Efforts are on to develop the PTA further, with an improved all digital flight control system, and a better turbojet engine. The Nishant is a hydraulically launched short-ranged UAV for the tactical battle area. It is currently being evaluated by the Indian Navy and the Indian Paramilitary forces as well. The DRDO is also going ahead with its plans to develop a new class of UAVs. These draw upon the experience gained via the Nishant programme, and will be substantially more capable. Referred to by the HALE (High Altitude Long Endurance) and MALE (Medium Altitude Long Endurance) designations. The MALE UAV has been tentatively named the Rustom, and will feature canards and carry a range of payloads, including optronic, radar, laser designators and ESM. The UAV will have conventional landing and take off capability. The HALE UAV will have features such as SATCOM links, allowing it to be commanded beyond line of sight. Other tentative plans speak of converting the LCA into a UCAV (unmanned combat aerial vehicle), and weaponising UAVs. DRDO Abhyas. DRDO AURA. DRDO Fluffy. DRDO Imperial Eagle. DRDO Kapothaka. DRDO Lakshya. DRDO Netra. DRDO Nishant. Pawan UAV. DRDO Rustom. DRDO Ulka. TAPAS-BH-201 DRDO Ghatak. Ghatak, previously known as Autonomous Unmanned Research Aircraft (AURA) is a stealthy unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) of flying-wing concept powered by dry Kaveri engine variant. It is designed and developed for the Indian Air Force (IAF) that will be capable of releasing missiles, bombs and precision-guided munitions from its internal weapons bay. Stealth Wing Flying Testbed (SWiFT). A precursor project under active development to test various technologies for DRDO Ghatak and future unmanned wingman bomber program. Anti-drone warfare. D-4 System (D4S). Electronics and Radar Development Establishment (LRDE) as part of anti-drone warfare developed D-4 which uses data fusion coming from multiple sensors for drone detection and is equipped with dual countermeasure techniques. D-4 has a 360° radar coverage for detecting micro drones within a range of 4 km, a radio frequency (RF) detector to check RF communications in 3 km range and an electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) sensor for visual identification within 2 km range. The RF and EO/IR sensor works in tandem for confirmation and verification of the target. This activates the first stage of countermeasure through RF/GNSS jammer to counter the incoming communication signals. It is part of the soft-kill framework. For second stage of countermeasure, D-4 comes equipped with a laser of range 150 m to 1 km which goes for the hard-kill. D-4 already demonstrated its capabilities to National Security Guard (NSG) and Indian Air Force (IAF) in 2020–21. It was first deployed during 2020 and again on 2021 Republic Day around New Delhi. For 15 August celebration in 2021, D-4 system was deployed as part of counter drone strategy around Red Fort.DRDO has already transferred the technology to Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) for mass production and is now considering it for private sector industries. On 31 August 2021, Indian Armed Forces signed deal with BEL to acquire static and road mobile D4S to enhance anti-drone capabilities. Under development. Drone detection and tracking system. Due to constant threat of UAV attacks, Instruments Research and Development Establishment (IRDE) is working on a new electro-optical drone detection system. The project is independent of what other DRDO labs are doing in anti-drone warfare domain especially the recently launched D-4 from LRDE. The IRDE system will be able to detect 4 feet long UAV flying at about 300 kmph from a distance of 3 km and a drone having a size of about 1 foot and flying at about 70 kmph from a distance of 2 km. The system will integrate thermographic camera, high-resolution video cameras, laser illuminators and laser range finders to detect and track rogue drones through electromagnetic and radio emission, reflection of microwave, infrared and visible light.. Since standalone systems and conventional air defense measures are insufficient to engage smaller drones, DRDO is planning to strengthen and build a web of network which will include multiple newly developed systems connected with the national airspace surveillance radars acting in unison for detecting, identifying, tracking and deploying anti-drone countermeasures such as soft or hard kill in case of emergency. Aerial Delivery System. CADS-500. Aerial Delivery Research and Development Establishment (ADRDE) on 18 December 2021, successfully completed demonstration flight of controlled aerial delivery system from Antonov An-32 that can deliver 500 kg payload with an accuracy of less 100 m CEP within the targeted area using high performance Ram-air parachute. The system utilizes GPS and NavIC for satellite guidance, attitude and heading reference system and an onboard computing system that helps in autonomous trajectory correction using waypoint navigation. CADS-500 can be dropped from 7,600 m above mean sea level and can cover a distance of 30 km. Indigenisation efforts. DRDO has been responsible for the indigenisation of key defence stores and equipment. DRDO has assisted Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and the IAF with the indigenisation of spares and assemblies for several aircraft. DRDO laboratories have worked in coordination with academic institutes, the CSIR and even ISRO over projects required for the Indian Air Force and its sister services. DRDO's infrastructure is also utilised by other research organisations in India. In the first ever initiative of its kind, DRDO has provided its patented Copper-Titanium (CuTi) alloy technology for commercial exploitation to a start-up company. The agreement between DRDO and Pahwa Metal Tech Pvt Ltd was signed on the sidelines of the Start Up India event at Delhi. Armaments. DRDO cooperates with the state-owned Ordnance Factories Board for producing its items. These have led to issues of marginal quality control for some items, and time-consuming rectification. Whilst these are common to the introduction of most new weapons systems, the OFB has had issues with maintaining the requisite schedule and quality of manufacture owing to their own structural problems and lack of modernisation. The DRDO has played a vital role in the development of this ability since the role of private organisations in the development of small arms and similar items has been limited. A significant point in case is the INSAS rifle which has been adopted by the Indian Army as its standard battle rifle and is in extensive service. There have been issues with rifle quality in use under extreme conditions in the heat, with the OFB stating that it will rectify these troubles with higher grade material and strengthening the unit. Prior troubles were also dealt with in a similar manner. In the meantime, the rifle has found favour throughout the army and has been ordered in number by other paramilitary units and police forces.In recent years, India's booming economy has allowed the OFB to modernise with more state funding coming its way, to the tune of US$400 million invested during 2002–07. The organisation hopes that this will allow it to modernise its infrastructure; it has also begun introducing new items, including a variant of the AK-47 rifles.The DRDO's various projects are: Body armour. Due to use of hard steel bullet core also called Armour Piercing (AP) that is made from tungsten carbide for Kalashnikov rifles by banned terror groups like Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), Defence Materials and Stores Research and Development Establishment (DMSRDE) developed a new medium-sized light weight 9 kg bulletproof vest for the Indian Army in 2021 for counter insurgency operation with increasing protection level. The bulletproof vest conforms to Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and the Front Hard Armour Panel (FHAP) was validated by Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory (TBRL). Clothing. Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences (DIPAS)  developed triple layer modular extreme weather waterproof clothing for the Indian Armed Forces weighing under 4.5 kg. The insulation can provide body protection up to minus 50 degree Celsius at 30,000 feet with around wind velocity of 60 km per hour preventing hypothermia and minimising the risks of frostbite. Small arms. The INSAS weapon system has become the standard battle rifle for the Indian Army and paramilitary units. Bulk production of a LMG variant commenced in 1998. It has since been selected as the standard assault rifle of the Royal Army of Oman.. In 2010, DRDO completed the development of Oleo-resin plastic hand grenades as a less lethal way to control rioters, better tear gas shells and short-range laser dazzlers.. Modern Sub Machine Carbine (MSMC) also called Joint Venture Protective Carbine (JVPC) is designed by the Armament Research and Development Establishment of DRDO and manufactured by the Ordnance Factory Board at Small Arms Factory, Kanpur and the Ordnance Factory Tiruchirappalli. Man-portable ATGM launcher. DRDO has developed an indigenous 84 mm calibre, 7 kg lightweight recoilless reusable ATGM launcher for the Indian army which will replace the 14 kg Carl Gustav Mark-II launcher. The DRDO has made extensive use of composites in its construction, resulting in the reduced weight. Explosives. Chemical Kit for Detection of Explosives (CKDE). A compact, low-cost and handy explosive detection kit has been designed and perfected for field detection of traces of explosives. The kit yields a colour reaction, based on which explosives can be detected in minutes. It is used for identification of all common military, civil and home-made explosive compositions, and is being used by Police and BSF for the detection of explosives. Explosive Detection Kit (EDK). In what has been termed a \"reverse technology transfer\", the Explosive Detection Kit widely used in India by bomb detection squads and the armed forces since 2002, would be manufactured and sold in the US. The kit uses reagents to detect various chemicals present in explosives. RaIDer-X. High Energy Materials Research Laboratory (HEMRL) of DRDO in collaboration with Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru and Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhopal (IISER-B) have developed a new explosive detection device called RaIDer-X (Rapid Identification Detector of eXplosives) which was showcased on 1 March 2020 during National Workshop on Explosive Detection (NWED-2020). It can detect bulk of pure as well as contaminated explosives of 20 different kinds from a standoff distance of 2 metre by using Universal Multiple Angle Raman Spectroscopy (UMARS) technique. Indian CL-20 explosive. A new high explosive is in the making at a DRDO lab that could replace other standard explosives of the armed forces such as RDX, HMX, FOX-7 and Amorphous Boron.  Scientists at the Pune-based High Energy Materials Research Laboratory (HEMRL) have already synthesized an adequate quantity of the new explosive CL-20, in their laboratory. The compound, 'Indian CL-20' or 'ICL-20', was indigenously developed in HEMRL using inverse technology. CL-20 is a Nitroamine class of explosive which is 20% more powerful than HMX which itself is more than potent RDX. CL-20-based shaped charges significantly improve the penetration of armour and could potentially be used in projectiles for the 120-mm Arjun tank main gun. The CL-20, due to its reduced sensitivity, enables easy handling and transportation which reduces the chances of mishap and loss of men, money, materials and machines. Artillery systems and ammunition. Pinaka multi barrel rocket launcher: This system has seen significant success. This system saw the DRDO cooperate extensively with the privately owned industrial sector in India. As of 2016, the Pinaka Mk1 system, with rockets of up to 40 km striking distance, has been successfully inducted in the Indian Army, with two regiments in service and two more on order. The Pinaka Mk2 program with rockets of up to 60 km in range, has cleared trials and has been recommended for induction as well.. A new long-range tactical rocket system is being developed, referred to as the Prahaar (with the name meaning \"Strike\", in Hindi) program, while an exportable derivative named Pragati (\"Progress\" in Hindi) was displayed in a South Korean arms fair. The DRDO's project has fielded a long-range tactical strike system, deriving from the successful Pinaka project. The aim is to develop a long-range system able to strike at a range of 100–120 km, with each rocket in the system, having a payload of up to 250 kg. The new MBRS's rocket will have a maximum speed of 4.7 mach and will rise to an altitude of 40 km, before hitting its target at 1.8 mach. There is also a move to put a sophisticated new inertial guidance system on the rockets whilst keeping cost constraints in mind. The DRDO has evaluated the IMI-Elisra developed trajectory control system and its technology, for use with the Pinaka, and a further development of the system could presumably be used with the new MBRL as well.. DRDO's ARDE developed 81 mm and the, 120 mm illuminating bombs and 105 mm illuminating shells for the Indian Army's infantry and Artillery.. A 51 mm Lightweight Infantry Platoon Mortar for the Indian Army. A man portable weapon, the 51 mm mortar achieves double the range of 2-inch (51 mm) mortar without any increase in weight. Its new HE bomb uses pre fragmentation technology to achieve improved lethality. Besides HE, a family of ammunition consisting of smoke, illuminating and practice bombs has also been developed. The weapon system is under production at Ordnance Factories.. Proximity fuses for missiles and artillery shells. Proximity fuses are used with artillery shells for \"air bursts\" against entrenched troops and in anti-aircraft and anti-missile roles as well.. Training devices: These include a mortar training device for the 81 mm mortar used by the infantry, a mortar training device for the 120 mm mortar used by the artillery, and a 0.50-inch (13 mm) sub-calibre training device for 105 mm Vijayanta tank gun.. The Indian Field Gun, a 105 mm field gun was developed for the Indian Army and is in production. This was a significant challenge for the OFB, and various issues were faced with its manufacture including reliability issues and metallurgical problems. These were rectified over time.. Submerged Signal Ejector cartridges (SSE), limpet mines, short-range anti-submarine rockets (with HE and practice warheads), the Indian Sea Mine which can be deployed against both ships and submarines. The DRDO also designed short- and medium-range ECM rockets which deploy chaff to decoy away anti-ship homing missiles. In a similar vein, they also developed a 3 in (76.2 mm) PFHE shell, pre-fragmented and with a proximity fuse, for use against anti-ship missiles and other targets, by the Navy. All these items are in production.. For the Indian Air Force, DRDO has developed Retarder Tail Units and fuze systems for the 450 kg bomb used by strike aircraft, 68 mm \"Arrow\" rockets (HE, Practice and HEAT) for rocket pods used in air-to-ground and even air-to-air (if need be), a 450 kg high-speed, low-drag (HSLD) bomb and practice bombs (which mimic different projectiles with the addition of suitable drag plates) and escape aid cartridges for Air Force aircraft. All these items are in production. Tank armament. DRDO's ARDE also developed other critical systems, such as the Arjun Main Battle Tank's 120 mm rifled main gun and is presently engaged in the development of the armament for the Future IFV, the \"Abhay\". The DRDO is also a member of the trials teams for the T-72 upgrade and its fire control systems. Earlier on, the DRDO also upgraded the Vijayanta medium tank with new fire control computers. Electronics and computer sciences. Electronic warfare. ECM stations for both communication and non-com (radar etc.) systems. The Indian Army has ordered its Signal Corps to be a prime contributor in the design and development stage, along with the DRDO's DLRL. The scale of this venture is substantial – it comprises COMINT and Electronic intelligence stations which can monitor and jam different bands for both voice/data as well as radar transmissions. In contrast to other such systems, Samyukta is an integrated system, which can perform the most critical battlefield EW tasks in both COM and Non-COM roles. The system will be the first of its type in terms of its magnitude and capability in the Army. Its individual modules can also be operated independently. A follow on system known as Sauhard is under development. The Safari IED suppression system for the army and paramilitary forces and the Sujav ESM system meant for high accuracy direction finding and jamming of communication transceivers.. Samyukta Electronic Warfare System. E-bomb : DRDO is developing electromagnetic pulse (EMP) device that can be dropped using satellite guidance. Research Centre Imarat (RCI) is the leading laboratory behind the project. EW systems for the Air Force. Radar warning receivers for the Indian Air Force of the Tarang series. These have been selected to upgrade most of the Indian Air Force's aircraft such as for the MiG-21, MiG-29, Su-30 MKI, MiG-27 and Jaguar as well as self-protection upgrades for the transport fleet.. The Tranquil RWR for MiG-23s (superseded by the Tarang project) and the Tempest jamming system for the Air Force's MiG's. The latest variant of the Tempest jamming system is capable of noise, barrage, as well as deception jamming as it makes use of DRFM. The DRDO has also developed a High Accuracy Direction Finding system (HADF) for the Indian Air Force's Su-30 MKIs which are fitted in the modular \"Siva\" pod capable of supersonic carriage. This HADF pod is meant to cue Kh-31 Anti radiation missiles used by the Su-30 MKI for SEAD.. DRDO stated in 2009 that its latest Radar warning receiver for the Indian Air Force, the R118, had gone into production. The R118 can also fuse data from different sensors such as the aircraft radar, missile/laser warning systems and present the unified data on a multi-function display. The DRDO also noted that its new Radar Warner Jammer systems (RWJ) were at an advanced stage of development and would be submitted for trials. The RWJ is capable of detecting all foreseen threats and jamming multiple targets simultaneously.. Other EW projects revealed by the DRDO include the MAWS project (a joint venture by the DRDO and EADS) which leverages EADS hardware and DRDO software to develop MAWS systems for transport, helicopter and fighter fleets. DRDO also has laser warning systems available.. A DIRCM (Directed Infra Red Countermeasures) project to field a worldclass DIRCM system intended to protect aircraft from infrared guided weapons.. The DRDO is also developing an all new ESM project in cooperation with the Indian Air Force's Signals Intelligence Directorate, under the name of \"Divya Drishti\" (Divine Sight). Divya Drishti will field a range of static as well as mobile ESM stations that can \"fingerprint\"  and track multiple airborne targets for mission analysis purposes. The system will be able to intercept a range of radio frequency emissions like radar, navigational, communication or electronic countermeasure signals. The various components of the project will be networked via SATCOM links.. Additional DRDO EW projects delivered to the Indian Air Force have included the COIN A and COIN B SIGINT stations. DRDO and BEL developed ELINT equipment for the Indian Air Force, installed on the service's Boeing 737s and Hawker Siddeley Avro aircraft. DRDO has also developed a Radar Fingerprinting System for the IAF and the Navy.. Another high accuracy ESM system is being developed by the DRDO for the AEW&C project. The Indian Air Force's AEW&C systems will also include a comprehensive ESM suite, capable of picking up both radars as well as conducting Communications Intelligence. Radars. The DRDO has steadily increased its radar development. The result has been substantial progress in India's ability to design and manufacture high power radar systems with locally sourced components and systems. This began with the development of short-range 2D systems (Indra-1) and has now extended to high power 3D systems like LRTR intended for strategic purposes. Several other projects span the gamut of radar applications, from airborne surveillance (AEW&C) to firecontrol radars (land based and airborne). A list of the tactical programs is as follows: Army. Multifunction Phased Array Radar and 3D Surveillance Radar for Akash Missile Weapon System (Rajendra & 3D CAR respectively). In production..

Maritime Patrol Airborne Radar for UAV. In development.. Coastal Surveillance Radar (CSR). In production.More details on the DRDO's productions as well as production-ready radar systems is as follows: INDRA series of 2D radars meant for Army and Air Force use. This was the first high power radar developed by the DRDO, with the Indra-I radar for the Indian Army, followed by Indra Pulse Compression (PC) version for the Indian Air Force, also known as the Indra-II, which is a low level radar to search and track low flying cruise missiles, helicopters and aircraft. These are 2D radars that provide range and azimuth information and are meant to be used as gap fillers. The Indra 2 PC has pulse compression providing improved range resolution. The series is used both by the Indian Air Force and the Indian Army.  Rajendra fire control radar for the Akash SAM: The Rajendra is stated to be ready. However, it can be expected that further iterative improvements will be made. The Rajendra is a high power Passive electronically scanned array radar (PESA), with the ability able to guide up to 12 Akash SAMs against aircraft flying at low to medium altitudes. The Rajendra has a detection range of 80 km with 18 km height coverage against small fighter-sized targets and is able to track 64 targets, engaging 4 simultaneously, with up to 3 missiles per target. The Rajendra features a fully digital high-speed signal processing system with an adaptive moving target indicator, coherent signal processing, FFTs, and variable pulse repetition frequency. The entire PESA antenna array can swivel 360 degrees on a rotating platform. This allows the radar antenna to be rapidly repositioned and even conduct all-round surveillance.. Central Acquisition Radar, a state of the art planar array S-band radar operating on the stacked beam principle. With a range of 180 km, it can track while scan 200 fighter-sized targets. Its systems are integrated on high mobility, locally built TATRA trucks for the Army and Air Force; however, it is meant to be used by all three services. Initially developed for the long-running Akash SAM system, seven were ordered by the Indian Air Force for their radar modernisation program and two of another variants were ordered by the Indian Navy for their P-28 Corvettes. The CAR has been a significant success for radar development in India, with its state of the art signal processing hardware. The ROHINI is the IAF specific variant while the REVATHI is the Indian Navy specific variant. The ROHINI has a more advanced Indian developed antenna in terms of power handling and beamforming technology while the REVATHI adds two-axis stabilisation for operation in naval conditions, as well as extra naval modes.. BFSR-SR, a 2D short-range Battle Field Surveillance Radar, meant to be man-portable. Designed and developed by LRDE, the project was a systematic example of concurrent engineering, with the production agency involved through the design and development stage. This enabled the design to be brought into production quickly. The radar continues to progress further in terms of integration, with newer variants being integrated with thermal imagers for visually tracking targets detected by the radar. Up to 10 BFSR-SR can be networked together for network-centric operation. It is in use with the Indian Army and the BSF as well as export customers.. Super Vision-2000, an airborne 3D naval surveillance radar, meant for helicopters and light transport aircraft. This program was subsequently superseded by the advanced XV-2004 which offered a more sophisticated architecture able to handle SAR and ISAR modes. The SV-2000 is a lightweight, high performance, slotted array radar operating in the X-Band. It can detect sea-surface targets such as a periscope or a vessel against heavy clutter and can also be used for navigation, weather mapping, and beacon detection. The radar can detect a large vessel at over 100 nautical miles (370 km). It is currently under modification to be fitted to the Advanced Light Helicopter and the Navy's Do-228's. Variants can be fitted to the Navy's Ka-25's as well. A more advanced variant of the Super Vision, known as the XV-2004 is now in trials and features an ISAR, SAR Capability intended for the Indian Navy's helicopter fleet.. Swordfish Long Range Tracking Radar, a 3D AESA was developed with assistance from Elta of Israel and is similar to Elta's proven EL/M-2080 Green Pine long-range Active Array radar. The DRDO developed the signal processing and software for tracking high-speed ballistic missile targets as well as introduced more ruggedisation. The radar uses mostly Indian designed and manufactured components such as its critical high power, L Band Transmit-Receive modules and other enabling technologies necessary for active phased array radars. The LRTR can track 200 targets and has a range of above 500 km. It can detect Intermediate-range ballistic missile. The LRTR would be amongst the key elements of the Indian Ballistic Missile Defence Programme. DRDO would provide the technology to private and public manufacturers to make these high power systems.. 3D Multi-Function Control Radar (MFCR) was developed as part of the Indian anti-ballistic missile program in cooperation with Thales of France. The MFCR is an active phased array radar and complements the Swordfish Long Range Tracking Radar, for intercepting ballistic missiles. The MFCR will also serve as the fire control radar for the AAD second-tier missile system of the ABM program. The AAD has a supplementary role against aircraft as well and can engage missiles and aircraft up to an altitude of 30 km. The MFCR fills out the final part of the DRDO's radar development spectrum and allows India to manufacture long-range 3D radars that can act as the nodes of an Air Defence Ground Environment system.. 2D Low-Level Lightweight Radar (LLLWR) for the Indian Army, known as the Bharani, which requires many of these units for gap-filling in mountainous terrain and has been ordered into production after clearing Indian Army trials. The Indian Air Force will also acquire a more advanced unit, called the Aslesha. The LLLWR is a 2D radar with a range of 40 km against a 2 square meter target, intended as a gap-filler to plug detection gaps versus low-level aircraft in an integrated Air Defence Ground network. The LLLWR makes use of Indra-2 technology, namely a similar antenna array, but has roughly half the range and is much smaller and a far more portable unit. The LLLWR can track while scan 100 targets and provide details about their speed, azimuth, and range to the operator. The LLLWR makes use of the BFSR-SR experience and many of the subsystem providers are the same. Multiple LLLWRs can be networked together. The LLLWR is meant to detect low-level intruders, and will alert Army Air Defence fire control units to cue their weapon systems.. 3D Short-Range Radar for the Indian Air Force – ASLESHA: The ASLESHA radars have a range of approximately 50 km against small fighter-sized targets and will be able to determine their range, speed, azimuth, and height. This radar will enable the Indian Air Force Air Defence units to accurately track low-level intruders. The radar is a semi-active phased array with a 1-meter square aperture. The DRDO was in discussions with the Indian Navy to mount these systems on small ships.. Multi-mode radar, a 3D radar is a HAL project with DRDO's LRDE as a subsystem provider. This project to develop an advanced, lightweight Multi-mode fire control radar for the LCA Tejas fighter had faced challenges and was delayed and finally superseded by a program called the Uttam to develop an AESA FCR for the Tejas LCA. The MMR program was finally completed with Elta's (Israel) assistance and became a hybrid system incorporating the original DRDO antenna, gimbal stabilisation, and Israeli backend. The multi-mode radar has the range (for detection of a small fighter target) around 100 km can track 10 targets, can engage 2 targets and uses the lightweight system. Originally, DRDO developed an all-new combined signal and the data processor had been developed, replacing the original separate units. The new unit is much more powerful and makes use of contemporary ADSP processors. The radar's critical hardware was also developed and validated. The software for the air-to-air mode has been developed considerably (including search and track while scan in both look up and look down modes) but air-to-ground modes were still being worked upon and proved problematic. The radar development was shown to be considerably more mature than previously thought but still faced significant delays and challenges. At Aero India 2009, it was revealed that the 3D MMR project has been superseded by the new 3D AESA FCR project led by LRDE. The MMR has been completed with Elta Israel's assistance and now involved Elta EL/M-2032 technology for Air-to-Ground mapping and targeting – in order to simplify testing, the Hybrid MMR basically became an Indian variant of the EL/M-2032 with an Indian antenna and gimbal system as Elta pointed out mixing and matching Indian hardware with Israeli software would, in essence, mean a new design with a significant time impact. The \"hybrid\" MMR has been tested, validated and will be supplied for the initial LCA Tejas fighters.. DRDO has indigenised components and improved subsystems of various other license-produced radars manufactured at BEL with the help of BEL scientists and other researchers. These improvements include new radar data processors for license-produced signal radars as well as local radar assemblies replacing the earlier imported ones.. BEL Weapon Locating Radar:Swati, a 3D radar developed from the Rajendra fire-control radar for the Akash system, uses a passive electronically scanned array to detect multiple targets for fire correction and weapon location. The system has been developed and demonstrated to the Army and orders have been placed In terms of performance, the WLR is stated to be superior to the AN/TPQ-37, several of which were imported by India as an interim system while the WLR got ready. The Indian Army has ordered 28 of these units.. 3D Tactical Control Radar: a new program, the TCR is an approximately 90 km ranged system for use by the Indian Army. A highly mobile unit, it is a variant of the 3D CAR unit and packaged into 2 as verses 3 units. The Indian Army has ordered many of the types for its Air Defense Units.Apart from the above, the DRDO has also several other radar systems currently under development or in trials, these include: Active Phased Array radar: a 3D radar for fighters, an MMR follow on, the APAR project aims to field a fully-fledged operational AESA fire control radar for the expected Mark-2 version of the Light Combat Aircraft. This will be the second airborne AESA program after the AEW&C project and intends to replicate DRDO's success with the ground-based radar segment to airborne systems. The overall airborne APAR program aims to prevent this technology gap from developing, with a broad-based program to bring DRDO up to par with international developers in airborne systems, both fire control, and surveillance. As of 2016, the radar was still in development, with variants expected to be fielded on future IAF fighters like the MCA or Tejas advanced Marks.. Synthetic aperture radar & Inverse synthetic aperture radar: the DRDO's LRDE is currently working on both SAR and ISAR radars for target detection and classification. These lightweight payloads are intended for both conventional fixed wing as well as UAV applications.. Airborne Warning and Control: a new radar-based on active electronically scanned array technology. The aim of the project is to develop an in-house capability for high power AEW&C systems, with the system covering the development of an S-Band AESA array. The aircraft will also have data-links to link fighters plus communicate with the IAF's C3I infrastructure as well as a local SATCOM (satellite communication system), along with other onboard ESM and COMINT systems. As of 2016, the system was in advanced trials and had achieved a TRL (Technical Readiness Level) of 8/10 with trials focusing on proving its self-protection equipment.. Medium-Range Battlefield Surveillance Radar: in 2009, the LRDE (DRDO) stated that it was working on a Long-range battlefield surveillance radar. It is possible that the BFSR-LR project has replaced this earlier project and the Indian Army will utilise the BEL built ELTA designed BFSR-MR's for Medium-Range surveillance while using the LRDE designed systems for Long Range surveillance. The 2D radar was to track ground targets and provide key intelligence to the Indian Army's artillery units, with the resultant information available on various tactical networks. As of 2016, this project was not active.. 3D Medium Power Radar: a spin-off of the experience gained via the 3D MFCR project, the 3D Medium Power Radar project is intended to field a radar with a range of approximately 300 km against small fighter-sized targets. Intended for the Indian Air Force, the radar is an active phased array, and will be transportable. It will play a significant role being used as part of the nodes of the Indian Air Force's enhanced Air Defence Ground Environment System. As of 2016, the radar was ready for IAF user trials and the IAF had ordered 8 MPRs already.. 3D Low-Level Transportable Radar: A new program, the LLTR is also called the Ashwini and is an approximately 150–200 km ranged system for use by the Indian Air Force. A highly mobile unit, it will also employ AESA technology, and open architecture to provide easy upgrades and a variety of modes and capabilities depending on the software fit. The aim of the 3D Medium Power Radar and LLTR is to offer systems that can be deployed in a variety of roles, from fire control to surveillance, and not be tied to one role alone. As of 2016, the LLTR program was in an advanced stage and expected to reach the trials phase. 3D Army AD Fire Control Radar: A new program for the Indian Army, the Atulya FCR is intended to provide Army AD units with a compact fire control system for their armament. The Indian Army has a total requirement of over 60 FCRs.. 3D Army Multi-Mission Radar: A new program for the Indian Army, the mobile compact radar system is expected to be capable of both artillery detection and air defense missions. As of 2016, it was in an advanced stage of development, with basic design completed and realisation of the prototype underway. Command and control software and decision-making tools. Tactical tools for wargaming: Shatranj and Sangram for the Army, Sagar for the Navy and air war software for the Air Force. All these systems are operational with the respective services.. C3I systems: DRDO, in cooperation with BEL and private industry has developed several critical C3I (command, control, communications and intelligence systems) for the armed services. Under the project \"Shakti\", the Indian Army aims to spend US$300 million to network all its artillery guns using the ACCS (Artillery Command and Control System). Developed by DRDO's Centre for Artificial Intelligence & Robotics, the system comprises computers and intelligent terminals connected as a wide area network. Its main subsystems are the artillery computer centre, battery computer, remote access terminal and a gun display unit. The ACCS is expected to improve the Army's artillery operations by a factor of 10 and allowing for more rapid and accurate firepower. The ACCS will also improve the ability of commanders to concentrate that fire-power where it is most needed. The DRDO and BEL have also developed a Battle Management system for the Indian Army for its tanks and tactical units.Other programmes in development for the Army include Corps level information and decision making software and tools, intended to link all units together for effective C3I. These systems are in production at DRDO's production partner, Bharat Electronics. These projects are being driven by the Indian Army Corps of Signals. The Indian Army is also moving towards extensive use of battlefield computers. DRDO has also delivered projects such as the Combat Net Radio for enhancing the Army's communication hardware. Data management and command and control systems for the Navy have been provided by the DRDO. The Navy is currently engaged in a naval networking project to network all its ships and shore establishments plus maritime patrol aircraft and sensors.. Radar netting and multi-sensor fusion software for linking the Indian Air Force's network of radars and airbases which have been operationalised. Other systems include sophisticated and highly complex mission planning and C3I systems for missiles, such as the Agni and Prithvi ballistic missiles and the Brahmos cruise missile. These systems are common to all three services as all of them utilise different variants of these missiles.. Simulators and training tools: DRDO and private industry have collaborated on manufacturing a range of simulators and training devices for the three services, from entry level tests for prospective entrants to the Indian Air Force, to sophisticated simulators for fighter aircraft, transports and helicopters, tanks and gunnery devices. Computing technologies. DRDO has worked extensively on high speed computing given its ramifications for most of its defence projects. These include supercomputers for computational flow dynamics, to dedicated microprocessor designs manufactured in India for flight controllers and the like, to high speed computing boards built around Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) components, similar to the latest trends in the defence industry. Supercomputing: DRDO's ANURAG developed the PACE+ Supercomputer for strategic purposes for supporting its various programmes. The initial version, as detailed in 1995, had the following specifications: The system delivered a sustained performance of more than 960 Mflops (million floating operations per second) for computational fluid dynamics programmes. Pace-Plus included 32 advanced computing nodes, each with 64 megabytes (MB) of memory that can be expanded up to 256MB and a powerful front-end processor which is a hyperSPARC with a speed of 66/90/100 megahertz (MHz). Besides fluid dynamics, these high-speed computer systems were used in areas such as vision, medical imaging, signal processing, molecular modeling, neural networks and finite element analysis. The latest variant of the PACE series is the PACE ++, a 128 node parallel processing system. With a front-end processor, it has a distributed memory and message passing system. Under Project Chitra, the DRDO is implementing a system with a computational speed of 2-3 Teraflops utilising commercial off the shelf components and the Open Source Linux Operating System.. Processors and other critical items: DRDO has developed a range of processors and application specific integrated circuits for its critical projects. Many of these systems are modular, in the sense that they can be reused across different projects. These include \"Pythagoras processor\" to convert cartesian to polar coordinates, ANUCO, a floating point coprocessor and several others, including the ANUPAMA 32-bit processor, which is being used in several DRDO projects.. Electronic components: one of the endeavours undertaken by the DRDO has been to create a substantial local design and development capability within India, both in the private and public sectors. This policy has led to several hard to obtain or otherwise denied items, being designed and manufactured in India. These include components such as radar subsystems (product specific travelling wave tubes) to components necessary for electronic warfare and other cutting edge projects. Today, there are a range of firms across India, which design and manufacture key components for DRDO, allowing it to source locally for quite a substantial chunk of its procurement. The DRDO has also endeavoured to use COTS (Commercial off the shelf) processors and technology, and follow Open Architecture standards, wherever possible, in order to pre-empt obsolescence issues and follow industry practise. One significant example is the development of an Open Architecture computer for the Light Combat Aircraft, based on the PowerPC architecture and VME64 standard. Variants of the earlier Mission computer utilising Intel 486 DX chips are already present on the Su-30 MKI, Jaguar and MiG-27 Upgrades for the Indian Air Force.. Infosys Autolay integrated automated software for designing 3-D laminated composite elements. Laser Science & Technology Centre (LASTEC). DRDO is working on a slew of directed energy weapons (DEWs). LASTEC has identified DEWs, along with space security, cyber-security and hypersonic vehicles as focus areas in the next 15 years. The aim is to develop laser-based weapons, deployed on airborne as well as seaborne platforms, which can intercept missiles soon after they are launched towards India in the boost phase itself. These will be part of the ballistic missile defence system being currently developed by DRDO. LASTEC is developing a 25-kilowatt laser system to hit a missile during its terminal phase at a distance of 5–7 km. LASTEC is also working on a vehicle-mounted gas dynamic laser-based DEW system, under project Aditya, which should be ready in three years. Project Aditya is a technology demonstrator to prove beam control technology. Ultimately, solid-state lasers would be used. For US President Donald Trump visit to India in 2020, DRDO deployed the LASTEC developed vehicle-mounted gas dynamic laser-based DEW system for counter-drone operations in Ahmedabad after completion of successful trial on 21 February 2020. It can detect, identify and destroy low flying objects of smaller size carrying explosives or arms and ammunitions. The Aditya directed energy weapon system was first deployed during the visit of Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro on Indian Republic Day 2020.LASTEC projects include: Non-Lethal systems: Hand-held laser dazzler to disorient adversaries, without collateral damage. 50-metre range.

At least 100-kilowatt solid-state laser systems, mounted on aircraft and ships, to destroy missiles in their boost phase itself. Status: Will take a decade. Directed Energy Weapons (DEW). In view of future warfare and contactless military conflict, DRDO initiated National Directed Energy Weapons Programme in collaboration with domestic private sector industries and various public institutions. It is working on several directed energy weapons (DEW) system such as KALI (electron accelerator) based on electromagnetic radiation or subatomic particle beam to achieve short, medium and long term national goals. Initially divided into two phases, Indian Army and Indian Air Force requested minimum of 20 tactical DEWs that can destroy smaller drones and electronic warfare radar systems within 6 km to 8 km distance. Under phase 2, another 20 tactical DEWs will be developed that can destroy target within 15 km to 20 km distance which will be used against troops and vehicles from ground or air platforms. As of 2020, a truck mounted DEW of 10 kilowatt laser with range of 2 km and portable tripod mounted 2 kilowatt DEW with range of 1 km were demonstrated in field operation successfully. DRDO is working on 50 kilowatt DEW along with ship motion compensation systems for the Indian Navy. In future, DRDO plans to work on a bigger 100 kW DEW. DURGA II. DRDO is working on a classified 100 kW directed energy weapon called Directionally Unrestricted Ray-Gun Array or DURGA. Combat vehicles & engineering. Tanks and armoured vehicles. Ajeya upgrade (Invincible): upgrade for the T-72 fleet, incorporating a mix of locally made and imported subsystems. 250 have been ordered. Local systems include the DRDO-developed ERA, a DRDO-developed laser warning system and combat net radio, the Bharat Electronics Limited advanced land navigation system consisting of fibre optic gyros and GPS, NBC protection and DRDO's fire detection and suppression system amongst other items. Imported systems include a compact thermal imager and fire control system and a new 1000 hp engine.. Anti-tank ammunition: DRDO developed the FSAPDS for the 125 mm calibre, meant for India's T-72 tanks, the 120 mm FSAPDS and HESH rounds for the Arjun tank and 105 mm FSAPDS rounds for the Army's Vijayanta and T-55 tanks. Significant amounts of 125 mm anti-tank rounds manufactured by the Ordnance Factory Board were rejected. The problems were traced to improper packaging of the charges by the OFB, leading to propellant leakage during storage at high temperatures. The locally developed rounds were rectified and requalified. Production of these local rounds was then restarted. Since 2001, over 130,000 rounds have been manufactured by the OFB. The DRDO said in 2005 that it had developed a Mk2 version of the 125 mm round, with higher power propellant for greater penetration. In parallel, the OFB announced in 2006 that it was also manufacturing 125 mm IMI (Israel Military Industries) rounds. It is believed that this might assist in improving the OFB's APFSDS manufacturing capability. These rounds and presumably the Mk2 round and will be used by both the T-72 and T-90 formations in the Indian Army.. Various armour technologies and associated subsystems from composite armour and explosive reactive armour to Radios (Combat Net Radio with frequency hopping and encryption) and Battle Management systems. Fire-control systems are currently in production at BEL for the Arjun tanks. The first batch in production have a hybrid Sagem-DRDO system, with Sagem sights and local fire control computer.. Arjun tank: The penultimate design was accepted by the Indian Army and is now in series production at HVF Avadi. The Arjun follows a template similar to the tanks developed by western nations, with containerised ammunition storage, with blast off panels, heavy Composite armour, a 120 mm gun (rifled as compared to smoothbore on most other tanks), a modern FCS with high hit probability and a 1,400 horsepower (1,000 kW) engine and a four-man crew. Originally designed in response to a possible Pakistani acquisition of the M1 Abrams, the project fell into disfavour once it became clear that Pakistan was instead standardising on cheaper (and less capable) T type tanks. In such a milieu, acquiring the Arjun in huge numbers is simply unnecessary for the Indian Army, given the additional logistic costs of standardising on an entirely new type. The Indian Army ordered 124 units in 2000 and an additional 124 units in 2010 and Mark 1A variant is already developed and ordered. Modification of BMP-2 series. India licence manufactures the BMP-2 with local components. The vehicle has been used as the basis for several locally designed modifications, ranging from missile launchers to engineering support vehicles. The DRDO and its various labs have been instrumental in developing these mission specific variants for the Indian Army. Armoured Engineering Reconnaissance Vehicle for enabling the combat engineers to acquire and record terrain survey data.

Under development. The DRDO also developed and productionised a microprocessor controlled triple tube torpedo launcher for the Indian Navy as well as a towed torpedo decoy. Marine propulsion. Air-independent propulsion. Naval Materials Research Laboratory (NMRL) in collaboration with Larsen & Toubro and Thermax developed a 270 kilowatt Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell (PAFC) to power the Scorpène design based Kalvari-class submarines. It produces electricity by reacting with hydrogen generated from sodium borohydride and stored liquid oxygen with phosphoric acid acting as an electrolyte. On 8 March 2021, NMRL successfully conducted the final develomental test of the indigenous air-independent propulsion (AIP) system. Shipboard electronic countermeasure. Defence Laboratory at Jodhpur developed Short Range Chaff Rocket (SRCR), Medium Range Chaff Rocket (MRCR) and Long Range Chaff Rocket (LRCR) as part of passive expendable electronic countermeasure technology for the Indian Navy as per their qualitative requirement. The trials were successfully completed in the Arabian Sea as of April 2021. Unlike other systems, it uses much less quantity of chaff material as decoy for incoming missiles making it useful for longer duration use. The technology was already cleared for mass production by Indian private-sector industries. Other projects. These have included indigenisation of various components (for instance, adsorbent material for submarines, radar components, naval ship signature reduction efforts and materials technology). DRDO has played a significant role in the development of warship grade steel in India and its productionisation. DRDO has also assisted private industry in developing EW trainers, ship simulators for training and health monitoring systems for onboard equipment. Other equipment for the Navy includes underwater telephone sets, and VLF communication equipment, for the Navy's submarines. DRDO's IRDE has also developed optronic fire control systems for the Navy's and the Coast Guard's ships. Information command and control systems. DRDO's labs have been part of projects to develop sophisticated command and control systems for the Navy, such as the EMCCA (Equipment Modular for Command and Control Application) which ties together various sensors and data systems. The EMCCA system gives commanders on the ship a consolidated tactical picture and adds to the ship's maritime combat power.DRDO labs are also engaged in supporting the Navy's ambitious naval enterprise wide networking system, a programme to link all naval assets together via datalinks, for sharing tactical information. Mines and targets. Three kinds of mines, processor based mine, moored mine and processor based exercise mine are in production for the Navy. Targets developed for the Navy include a static target called the Versatile Acoustic target and a mobile target called the programmable deep mobile target (PDMT). In development. A Submarine Escape set, used by crew to escape from abandoned submarines. The set consists of breathing apparatus and Hydro-suit.. New generation Sonars and EW equipment.. Heavyweight torpedoes, underwater remotely operated vehicles, improved signature reduction technology for naval applications. Missile systems. Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP). The IGMDP was launched by the Indian Government to develop the ability to develop and design a missile locally, and manufacture a range of missile systems for the three defence services. The programme has seen significant success in its two most important constituents – the Agni missiles and the Prithvi missiles, while two other programmes, the Akash surface to air missile (SAM) and the anti-tank Nag missile have seen significant orders. The Trishul missile, a sub-programme to develop short-range SAM for the Indian Armed Forces faced persistent problems throughout its development. Finally the project was terminated in 2008 as a technology demonstrator. Prithvi. The Prithvi (Earth) missiles are a range of SRBMs produced for the Indian Air Force and Army; a variant for the Navy has been deployed on Sukanya class patrol vessel. Another submarine-launched variant known as the K-15 is under development. The Prithvi is an extremely accurate liquid fuelled missile with a range of up to 350 km. While relatively inexpensive and accurate, with a good payload, its logistics footprint is high, on account of it being liquid fuelled. Agni. The Agni (Fire) ballistic missiles are a range of MRBMs, IRBMs, ICBMs meant for long-range deterrence. The Agni-III has range of up to 3,500 km (2,175 mi). The Agni-I and Agni-II have been productionised, although exact numbers remain classified.. First trials of the Agni-III saw problems and the missile test did not meet its objectives. The second test was successful. Further tests of the Agni-III are planned to validate the missile and its subsystems, which include new propellant and guidance systems, a new reentry vehicle and other improvements.The Agni-V missile is an Intercontinental ballistic missile meant for long-range deterrence. The Agni-V is the newest version and has the longest range of up to 5000–6000 km. Agni-V would also carry Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle payloads and will have countermeasures against Anti-ballistic missile systems. It was successfully test-fired on 19 April 2012. The missile will utilise a canister and will be launched from it. Sixty percent of the missile will be similar to the Agni-III missile. Advanced technologies like ring laser gyroscope and accelerometer will be used in the new missile.. DRDO plans to develop reusable missiles which will be a combination of ballistic and cruise missile technology. During an interview on 24 August 2014, The DRDO chief disclosed the plans of DRDO designing a Long Range ballistic Anti-ship missile. Agni-P. Agni-P is a new generation of medium range ballistic missile from the Agni series that incorporates the latest developments in design, composite materials, fuels, navigation and guidance system. As of 2021, it is the smallest and lightest missile of the Agni family. Akash. The Akash (Sky or ether) is a medium-range surface-to-air missile system consisting of the command guidance ramjet powered Akash along with the dedicated service specific launchers, battery control radar (the Rajendra Block III), a central acquisition radar, battery and group control centres. The Akash project has yielded spinoffs like the Central Acquisition radar and weapon locating radar.. The Akash system cleared its user trials with the Indian Air Force in 2007. The user trials had the Akash intercept flying targets at ITR, Chandipur. The Akash missile struck its targets in every test. The Indian Air force has since been satisfied with the performance of the missile and ordered two squadrons of the Akash, with a squadron having eight launchersThe Indian Air Force placed an order for an additional six squadrons of the Akash SAM in 2010, with an order of 750 missiles (125 per squadron). This order makes a total of a 1000 Akash SAMs on order for the Indian Air Force for eight squadrons. In June 2010, the Defence Acquisition Council placed an order of the Akash missile system, valued at ₹12,500 crore (US$1.6 billion). Bharat Dynamics Limited will be the system integrator and nodal production agency for the Akash Army variant. Trishul. The Trishul (Trident) is a short range surface-to-air missile developed by India. It was developed by Defence Research and Development Organisation as a part of the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program. It can also be used as an anti-sea skimmer from a ship against low flying attacking missiles. Trishul has a range of 9 km (5.6 mi) It is powered by a dual thrust propulsion stage using high-energy solid propellant. Trishul weighs 130 kg (290 lb) and is capable of carrying a 15 kg (33 lb) warhead.. The Trishul missile project was commissioned in 1983 as a part of Integrated Guided Missile Development Program. The project was to be completed by 1992 and the missile would be fitted to Brahmaputra-class frigates as an anti-sea skimmer. In 1985, Trishul made its first unguided flight from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota. The missile made its first full range guided flight in 1989. In 1992, the missile was successfully tested against a target and reached Mach 2 speed. In 1997, the associated radar systems for detecting the incoming sea-skimmer were operational. The launch system was developed by Bharat Dynamics Limited in 1998. In 2003, Government of India announced that the missile will be a technology demonstrator and de-linked it from other projects. The missile was successfully test-fired in 2005. The development cost of the programme was ₹2.826 billion (US$35 million) and the Defence minister announced the official closure of the programme in 2008. Nag. The Nag anti-tank missile (Cobra) is a guided missile system intended for the Indian Air Force and the Indian Army. The Army will deploy the Nag on ground-based launchers and from helicopters, whereas the Air Force will rely on helicopter based units. The Nag has an Imaging Infrared (IIR) seeker and has a top and direct attack capability, with a tandem warhead. The Army's land missile carrier and launcher, known as the Namica, carries several ready to use Nag missiles within and four Nag missiles in an extendable launcher above the turret. The Namica has its own FLIR based sighting and fire control unit. The Air Force and Army will also use their Advanced Light helicopters (ALH) (HAL Dhruv) and the HAL Light Combat Helicopter (LHC) as Nag carriers. The ALHs will be equipped with IRDE (DRDO) developed HELITIS (Heliborne Imaging and Targeting systems) with a combination of a FLIR and laser range finder in a stabilised turret for target acquisition and designation. The thermal imager is likely to be imported, but the gimballed turret, stabilisation, laser range finder and associated electronics have been designed in India and will be manufactured locally. The Nag ATGM is regarded as a highly capable missile, even though its development has been protracted, mainly due to the technological challenges of developing a state of the art IIR sensor equipped top attack missile. The Nag is still cheaper than most imported missiles in its category and is earmarked for the Army and Air Force.. The Nag anti-tank guided missile was cleared for production in July 2009 and there are uncorroborated reports since that it may be purchased by Tanzania, Botswana and Morocco. The Nag will complement the existing Russian 9M113 Konkurs Anti-tank guided missile and European missile MILAN in Indian usage, both of which are manufactured under licence by Bharat Dynamics Limited. Intercontinental ballistic missile. Surya. DRDO started the project of developing an intercontinental ballistic missile, codename Surya in 1994. The information became public in 2010. It will be a three-stage missile with solid and liquid fuel as propellant. Anti-tank guided missile. Cannon-launched guided projectile. SAMHO. Developed as an indigenous replacement for LAHAT against heavily armoured vehicle and low flying objects. It can be fired from 120 mm rifled gun on Arjun MBT. MPATGM. Man Portable Anti-Tank Guided Missile or MPATGM, is a third generation fire-and-forget anti-tank guided missile derived from Nag project under IGMDP developed by DRDO in collaboration with private sector defence contractor VEM Technologies. SANT. A fourth generation ATGM developed from NAG as a stand-off range weapon that comes with dual seeker configuration. Cruise missile. Brahmos. Launched as a joint venture between India's DRDO and the Russian NPO, the BrahMos programme aims at creating a range of missile systems derived from the Yakhont missile system. Named the \"BrahMos\" after the Brahmaputra and the Moskva rivers, the project has been highly successful. The Indian Navy has ordered the BrahMos Naval version, both slant-launched and vertically launched, for its ships; the Indian Army has ordered two regiments worth of land-launched missiles for long-range strike; and an air-launched version is in development for the Indian Air Force's Su-30 MKIs and the Navy's Tu-142 long-range aircraft.. The DRDO has been responsible for the navigational systems on the BrahMos, aspects of its propulsion, airframe and seeker, plus its Fire Control Systems, Mobile Command posts and Transporter Erector Launcher.An upgraded version of the 290 km-range BrahMos supersonic cruise missile was successfully test-fired by India on 2 December 2010 from Integrated Test Range (ITR) at Chandipur off the Odisha coast.. \"Block III version of BrahMos with advanced guidance and upgraded software, incorporating high manoeuvres at multiple points and steep dive from high altitude was flight tested successfully from Launch Complex III of ITR,\" its Director S P Dash said after the test-firing from a mobile launcher at 1100 hours. The 8.4-metre missile which can fly at 2.8 times the speed of sound is capable of carrying conventional warheads of up to 300 kg for a range of 290 km.. It can effectively engage ground targets from an altitude as low as ten metres for surgical strikes at terror training camps across the border without causing collateral damage. BrahMos is capable of being launched from multiple platforms like submarine, ship, aircraft and land based Mobile Autonomous Launchers (MAL). The Block III BrahMos has the capability of scaling mountain terrain and can play a vital role in precision strike in the northern territories. The advanced cruise missile can fly close to the rough geographies and kill the target A five-year development timeframe is anticipated.The hypersonic Brahmos 2 is to be developed as a follow on to the original Brahmos. The missile would fly at speeds of 5-7 Mach. Nirbhay. Nirbhay (Fearless) is a long range, all-weather, subsonic cruise missile powered by solid rocket booster and turbofan or a turbojet engine that can be launched from multiple platforms and is capable of carrying conventional and nuclear warheads. The missile is guided by an inertial navigation system and a radio altimeter for the height determination. It carries a Ring Laser Gyroscope (RLG) based guidance, control and navigation system with additional MEMS based Inertial Navigation System (INS) along with radiodetermination-satellite service GPS/NAVIC. With a range of about 1000 km, Nirbhay is capable of delivering 24 different types of warheads depending on mission requirements. Hypersonic weapons development. Shaurya. The Shaurya (Valor) is a canister-launched hypersonic surface-to-surface tactical missile developed by the Indian Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) for use by the Indian Armed Forces. Similar to the BrahMos, Shaurya is stored in composite canisters, which makes it much easier to store for long periods without maintenance as well as to handle and transport. It also houses the gas generator to eject the missile from the canister before its solid propellant motors take over to hurl it at the intended target.. Shaurya missiles can remain hidden or camouflaged in underground silos from enemy surveillance or satellites till they are fired from the special storage-cum-launch canisters. The Shaurya system will require some more tests before it becomes fully operational in two to three years. Moreover, defence scientists say the high-speed, two-stage Shaurya has high maneuverability which also makes it less vulnerable to existing anti-missile defence systems.. It can be easily transported by road. The missile, encased in a canister, is mounted on a single vehicle, which has only a driver's cabin, and the vehicle itself is the launch platform. This \"single vehicle solution\" reduces its signature – it cannot be easily detected by satellites – and makes its deployment easy. The gas generator, located at the bottom of the canister produces high pressure gas, which expands and ejects the missile from the tube.. The centrepiece of a host of new technologies incorporated in Shaurya is its ring laser gyroscope (RLG) and accelerometer. The indigenous ring laser gyroscope, a sophisticated navigation and guidance system developed by the Research Centre Imarat (RCI) based in Hyderabad is a highly classified technology.. In test flights the RLG functioned exceptionally well. the RLG monitors the missile's position in space when it is flying. The missile's on-board computer will use this information and compare it with the desired position. Based on the difference between the missile's actual and desired positions, the computer will decide the optimum path and the actuators will command the missile to fly in its desired/targeted position.. The third test of the RLG was successful on 24 September 2011, reaching a speed of 7.5 mach. It is now ready for production. Under development. Hypersonic Technology Demonstrator Vehicle (HSTDV). An unmanned scramjet demonstration aircraft to attain hypersonic speed flight that will also act as carrier vehicle for future hypersonic and long-range cruise missiles. It will include multiple spinoff in civilian applications including the launching of satellites at lower cost. Tactical ballistic missile. Prahaar. Prahaar is a solid-fueled surface-to-surface guided short-range tactical ballistic missile developed by DRDO of India. It would be equipped with omni-directional warheads and could be used for hitting both tactical and strategic targets. It has a range of about 150 km. It was successfully test-fired on 21 July 2011 from the Integrated Test Range (ITR) at Chandipur. Pralay. It is a solid fuel short range tactical missile under development based on the technology of Pradyumna Ballistic Missile Interceptor. Upon completion of the project, Pralay will replace the older generation liquid fueled Prithvi missile. Pranash. DRDO is developing a 200 km range single stage solid fuel missile that can carry conventional warhead for battlefield use. The testing phase of the new missile will start from 2021. Beyond-visual-range missile. Astra. Astra is a 110 km (68 mi) class, active radar homing air-to-air missile meant for beyond-visual-range missile combat. Air-augmented rocket. Solid Fuel Ducted Ramjet (SFDR). From year 2010 onwards, Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) started working on critical technologies for future longer range air-to-air missile that can also be used in surface-to-air missile systems. Solid Fuel Ducted Ramjet (SFDR) is one such missile propulsion technology that uses thrust modulated ducted rocket with a reduced smoke nozzle-less missile booster. Anti-radiation missile. Rudram-1. NGARM (New Generation Anti-Radiation Missile) now officially called Rudram-1 is a 100–250 km range air-to-surface, anti-radiation missile to provide air superiority, tactical capability to Indian Air Force for suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD), that can be launched from a range of altitudes. Surface-to-air missile. Akash-NG. Akash-NG is new generation of Akash missile developed by DRDO.The missile uses a Ku-band Active radar seeker, an active electronically scanned array Multi-Function Radar (MFR) and optical proximity fuze will improve the effectiveness of the missile against targets with low radar cross-section. It is the successor of Akash missile and has range of 80 km. Barak 8. India and Israel have worked out an agreement to develop and produce the long-range Barak 8 air defence system for both the Indian and the Israeli militaries. The initial co-development funding is about US$350 million, of which IAI will finance 50 per cent. The venture is a tripartite one, between the DRDO, the Indian Navy, and the IAI. The missile is referred to as the LRSAM in Indian Government literature, and will have a range of 72 km (45 mi). Israel Aircraft Industries refers to the system as Barak-8. IAI states that the missile will have a dual pulse motor, is vertically launched and is able to engage both aircraft and sea skimming missiles. It has a fully active seeker, and the Barak-8 Weapons system is capable of multiple simultaneous engagements. It will have a two way datalink for midcourse update, as well as be able to integrate into larger C3I networks. The primary fire control sensor for the naval Barak-8/LRSAM will be the ELTA MF-STAR Naval AESA radar which Israel claims to be superior to many existing systems worldwide.. The dual pulse rocket motor for the SAM was developed by DRDO, and the prototypes were supplied to IAI for integration with IAI systems to develop the complete missile.. The other variant of the LRSAM will be fielded by the Indian Air Force. Along with the Akash SAM, the LRSAM fills a longer range requirement and both types will complement each other. Each unit of the MR-SAM would consist of a command and control centre, with an acquisition radar, a guidance radar and 3 launchers with eight missiles each.. A 4-year, US$300 million System Design & Development phase to develop unique system elements and an initial tranche of the land-based missiles is estimated. The radars, C2 centres, TEL's and missiles will be codeveloped by Israel and India. In turn, IAI and its Israeli partners have agreed to transfer all relevant technologies and manufacturing capabilities to India allowing India to manufacture the LRSAM systems locally as well as support them. The Barak-8 next generation long-range surface-to-air missile (LR-SAM) had its first test-flight on 29 May 2010. QRSAM. DRDO developed QRSAM as part of replacement program for the Soviet era 9K33 Osa and 2K12 Kub that is being used extensively by Indian Army and Indian Air Force. It is built for an all weather, all terrain scenario with electronic counter-countermeasure system against aerial targets. It has an engagenment range of minimum 3 km to a maximum of 30 km that is powered by solid fuel propellant, maintaining a speed of 4.7 Mach in flight. The missile system uses a two way data link communication with active radar homing. XRSAM. DRDO is developing a long range surface to air missile to supplement Barak-8 and S-400 systems for its multi-tier air defence umbrella protecting the Indian airspace. It will use some of the key technologies developed during Ballistic Missile Defence Programme. VL-SRSAM. Vertical launched-Short Range Surface- to-Air Missile (VL-SRSAM) is a quick reaction short range missile being developed by DRDO for naval service and to replace Barak 1 missile.The missile is naval variant of Astra with some design and technological changes for an all weather point and area defence role against flying targets such as fighter aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles etc. It has the range of 45 km. VSHORADS. VSHORADS or Very Short Range Air Defence System is a man portable air defence system (MANPAD) meant for neutralizing low altitude aerial threats at short ranges. The missile uses solid fuel based dual-thrust rocket motor and is developed by Research Centre Imarat . On 27 September 2022, DRDO conducted two successful launches from Integrated Test Range, Chandipur. To increase mid-air maneuverability, the missile is equipped with miniaturized Reaction Control System (RCS). Ballistic Missile Defence Programme. Unveiled in 2006, the ABM project was a surprise to many observers. While DRDO had revealed some details about the project over the years, its progress had been marked by strict secrecy, and the project itself was unlisted, and not visible among DRDO's other programmes. The ABM project has benefited from all the incremental improvements achieved by the DRDO and its associated industrial partners via the long-running and often contentious Akash missile and Trishul missile programmes. However, it is a completely new programme, with much larger scope and with predominantly new subsystems.. The ABM project has two missiles—namely the AAD (Advanced Air Defence) and PAD (Prithvi Air Defence) missiles. The former is an endo-atmospheric interceptor of new design, which can intercept targets to a height of 30 km (19 mi). Whereas the latter is a modified Prithvi missile, dubbed the Axo-atmospheric interceptor (AXO) with a dedicated second stage kill vehicle for ballistic missile interception, up to an altitude of 80 km (50 mi). Both these missiles are cued by an active phased array Long Range Tracking Radar, similar to the Elta GreenPine but made with locally developed components, which include DRDO-developed transmit/receive modules. The ABM system also makes use of a second radar, known as the Multi-Function Control Radar which assists the LRTR in classifying the target, and can also act as the fire control radar for the AAD missile. The MFCR, like the LRTR, is an active phased array system.. The entire system was tested in November 2006, under the Prithvi Air Defence Exercise, when a prototype AXO missile intercepted another Prithvi missile at a height of 50 km (31 mi). This test was preceded by an \"electronic test\" in which an actual target missile was launched, but the entire interceptor system was tested electronically, albeit no actual interceptor was launched. This test was successful in its entirety. The AAD Missile was tested in December 2007 which successfully intercepted a modified Prithvi missile simulating the M-9 and M-11 class of ballistic missiles. Interception happened at an altitude of 15 km (9 mi). Anti-satellite weapon. After testing the over 5,000 km Agni V missile, which went up to 600 km into space during its parabolic trajectory, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) now feels it can fashion deadly anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons in double-quick time. Agni V gives you the boosting capability and the 'kill vehicle', with advanced seekers, will be able to home into the target satellite, DRDO chief, VK Saraswat said. The defence ministry in 2010 had even drafted a 15-year \"Technology Perspective and Roadmap\", which held development of ASAT weapons \"for electronic or physical destruction of satellites in both LEO (2,000-km altitude above earth's surface) and the higher geosynchronous orbit\" as a thrust area in its long-term integrated perspective plan under the management of DRDO. Consequently, defence scientists are focusing on \"space security\" to protect India's space assets from electronic or physical destruction. Another spin-off from Agni V test is that the DRDO feels it can work towards launching mini-satellites for battlefield use if an adversary attacks the country's main satellites. On 27 March 2019, India conducted a successful Anti-satellite missile test from Dr A P J Abdul Kalam Island in Odisha. Submarine-launched ballistic missile. K Missile series. Sagarika. The K-15 Sagarika is a nuclear-capable submarine-launched ballistic missile belonging to the K Missile family with a range of 750 kilometres (466 mi) travelling at hypersonic speed of Mach 7.5. Sagarika can carry a payload of up to 500 kilograms (1,102 lb). Sagarika was developed at the DRDO Missile Complex in Hyderabad.. This missile will form part of the triad in India's nuclear deterrence, and will provide retaliatory nuclear strike capability. The development of this missile (under the title Project K-15) started in 1991. The Indian government first confirmed Sagarika's development seven years later (1998), when the then Defence Minister, George Fernandes, announced it during a press conference.. The development of the underwater missile launcher, known as Project 420 (P420), was completed in 2001 and handed over to the Indian Navy for trials. The missile was successfully test-fired six times, and tested to its full range up to three times. The test of missile from a submerged pontoon was conducted in February 2008.. Sagarika is being integrated with India's nuclear-powered Arihant class submarines that began sea trials on 26 July 2009. K-4 (missile). K-4 is intermediate-range sunbmarine launched missile developed by DRDO for the Indian Navy's Arihant class submarine and future S5-class submarine. The missile has length of 12 metres and diameter of 1.3 metres. It weighs nearly 17 tonnes and can carry a warhead weighing up to 2 tonnes. This missile give capability to strike deep into the enemy territory as it has the range of 3500 km. K4 missile can perform three-dimensional maneuvers and has high accuracy.. Some sources also report that it is a compact version of Agni-III as the Agni-III is nearly 17m in length so it cannot be deployed in the Arihant class submarine.. K-4 has completed all the user trials and ready for induction into the service. K-5 missile. K-5 missile is intercontinental-range submarine launched missile being developed by DRDO. It will have the range of 5000 km and will carry the warhead of 2 tonnes. It will be solid-fuelled. It will be ready for test in 2022. K-5 will be fastest missile in his family. K-6 missile. K-6 missile is intercontinental-range submarine launched missile being developed by DRDO. It will have a range of 6000–8000 km. It will also carry the payload of 2 tonnes. It will enable the Navy's submarine to aim at any country while patrolling in the \"safe haven\". Precision-guided munition. Sudarshan laser-guided bomb. India's first laser-guided bomb, Sudarshan is the latest weapon system developed indigenously to occupy the niche of a precision delivery mechanism. It can be fitted to a 450 kilograms (990 lb) gravity bomb and can guide it to the target using lasers with a CEP (Circular Error Probability) of 10 metres. DRDO Glide Bombs. Garuthmaa & Garudaa are DRDO's 1000 kg Glide Bombs. These are India's first indigenously designed glide bomb with a range of 30 km (Garudaa) to 100 km (Garuthmaa). DRDO Smart Anti-Airfield Weapon (SAAW). Smart Anti-Airfield Weapon (SAAW) is a long-range precision-guided anti-airfield weapon engaging ground targets with high precision up to a range of 100 kilometres. High Speed Low Drag Bomb (HSLD). This is a family of both guided and unguided munition developed by the Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE) for the new generation Indian, NATO and Russian origin aircraft. Communication-Centric Intelligence Satellite (CCI-Sat). Communication-Centric Intelligence Satellite is an advanced reconnaissance satellite, being developed by DRDO. It will be India's first officially declared spy satellite and according to ISRO it should be in the sky by 2014. This satellite will help Indian intelligence agencies to significantly boost surveillance of terror camps in neighbouring countries. Future Plans. AVATAR. Aerobic Vehicle for Transatmospheric Hypersonic Aerospace Transportation also known as AVATAR is a DRDO concept for a robotic single-stage reusable spaceplane capable of horizontal takeoff and landing, that can be used for space launches of low cost military and commercial satellite. GATET engine. The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has launched a ₹100 crore (US$12.5 million) project in R&D in the area of gas turbines, a DRDO official said in April 2010. Under the initiative of DRDO's Aeronautics Research and Development Board, R&D projects, which need investment in the region of ₹50 lakh (US$62,616.80) to ₹5 crore (US$626,167.90), would be considered for funding. GTRE was the nodal agency to spearhead this venture, called GATET Naval Anti-Ship Missile (NASM). The project is sanctioned in 2017 for a 5–55 km short range air-launched Naval Anti-Ship Missile (NASM–SR) to replace Sea Eagle missiles in use by the Indian Navy with future variants ranged in excess of 150 km. Long Range - Land Attack Cruise Missile (LR-LACM). Aeronautical Development Establishment (ADE) is working on developing a cruise missile with a range greater than 1,000 km with land and under water variant for Army and Navy respectively. It will use SFDR for propulsion that will take the missile to supersonic speed. LR-LACM  is developed to achieve greater CEP than BrahMos with increase in warhead load capaciity.\n\n### Passage 3\n\n Lineage.

The 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance), a General Reserve Unit attached to Headquarters, 37th Medical Battalion (Separate), Medical Field Service School for administration, was further attached for training and operational control. The detachment was activated by General Order Number 10, Headquarters, Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, Texas, dated 6 April 1953, under TO&E 8–500, Cell: RA, 25 August 1952. By 31 December 1953, the unit had approximately 95 percent of its authorized equipment.Captain John W Hammett was assigned as the detachment's first commander, and both organized the detachment and trained its newly assigned aviators, who were all newly assigned Medical Service Corps officers fresh out of flight school as well as leading the unit through its first unit tests.  The detachment was equipped with H-13E aircraft with exterior mounted litters and litter covers.The principal activity of this unit consisted of participation in evacuation demonstrations for the Medical Field Service School.Six officers and 26 enlisted men were assigned to the unit at year end. The total authorized strength of the detachment was 7 officers and 24 enlisted.Unit training began on 21 September 1953. In accordance with Army Training Program 8–220. Almost immediately many problems were encountered. The principal difficulty was in the maintenance of aircraft, Within a few days after unit training had begun the program was partially abandoned. On 21 October 1953 the detachment was attached to the 37th Medical Battalion (separate), Medical Field Service School, for administration and training. On 6 October 1953 the unit training was again started with certain modifications of the program to allow more time for aircraft maintenance. This training was completed by 31 December 1953.Effective 7 January 1954 the 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) and the 274th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance), assigned to Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, Texas were relieved from attachment to the Medical Field Service School and were attached to Brooks Air Force Base for quarters and rations in accordance with General Order Number 2, Headquarters, Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, Texas, dated 22 January 1954.From 28 June through 4 July 1954, all of the aircraft assigned to Brooke Army Medical Center, including those of the 57th and 274th under Hammett's command, were deployed to support flood relief efforts along the Rio Grande River near Langtry, Texas caused by Hurricane Agnes. The detachments sent seven aircraft to Laughlin Air Force Base and began using it as a base for their search operations. They began by evacuating passengers, luggage, and mail from a Southern Pacific train which had been cut off from ground evacuation, evacuating 85 passengers to the air base, and then again when shortages of drinking water occurred on the base. The aftermath of the storm made flying difficult.During the period 9 February — 2 March 1955, the 67th Medical Group with attached 603d Medical Company (Clearing)(Separate) and the 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) was attached to III Corps at Fort Hood, Texas, for participation in Exercise Blue Bolt. Attached to the Group upon arrival from Fort Riley, Kansas was the 47th Surgical Hospital and 928th Medical Company (Ambulance)(Separate). The Group's assigned mission was to furnish field Army Medical Service support (actual and simulated) to the 1st Armored Division and III Corps. One hundred twenty-eight actual casualties were evacuated to the 603d Medical Company (Clearing). The Ambulance Company evacuated 1025 simulated and actual patients. The 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) had the mission of evacuating actual casualties, completing seven pickups with an average patient delivery time of 38 minutes. This was an outstanding accomplishment when measured against the time space factors involved. Twelve hundred patients were routed through an Evacuation Hospital (simulated) established and operated by the Clearing Company.Effective 10 July 1955, the 67th Medical Group was temporarily reorganized to the 67th Medical Service Battalion (ATFA Provisional) by General Order 21, Brooke Army Medical Center, 7 July 1955. The 32d Medical Depot (Army), 47th and 53d Field Hospitals, and the 82d Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) were also reorganized as ATFA Provisional units by the same authority. On 15 July 1955, Dental Service Team KJ (Provisional #1), Team KJ (Provisional #2), and Medical Detachment (ATFA Provisional Team QA) were activated by Brooke Army Medical Center and attached to the 67th Medical Service Battalion (ATFA). These units were to participate in Exercise Sagebrush during the forthcoming months. The 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) was also to participate.On 1 September 1955 an extensive program of training was placed in effect to prepare all participating units for Sagebrush. Many obstacles in personnel, equipment, and limited training time were encountered. By 15 October after extensive field preparation to include special ATFA testing by Brooke Army Medical Center, these units were considered sufficiently advanced to assume their responsibility though 25% of the newly assigned personnel in the field hospitals lacked the MOS training required. Just prior to leaving, the Group presented the largest mounted review in Brooke Army Medical Center history. Approximately 250 vehicles of all types participated.On 25 October 1955 all units moved overland to Louisiana. No major accidents occurred. Valuable experience in atomic warfare operations and the handling of mass casualties was received. The hospitals provided medical care and treatment for both actual and simulated casualties. The 67th Medical Service Battalion exercised operational control over attached medical units. The 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) received a mission of evacuating actual casualties, reconnaissance, and supply, flying a total of 289 hours. The 82d Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) was further attached to III Corps as a part of the III Corps Aviation Company, executing a total of 165 missions involving 313 flying hours. The 32d Medical Depot (ATFA) supported all units of the Ninth Army during the maneuver. Approximately 10 tons of medical supplies were received, separated, stored, and tallied.At the conclusion of the exercise, all ATFA Medical units returned to Fort Sam Houston in December with the exception of the 47th Field Hospital which remained in the maneuver area on temporary duty at Fort Polk, Louisiana, rendering medical support to Engineer and Signal Corps units. The unit engaged in the close out phase remained ATFA Provisional at end of 1955.General Order 42, Brooke Army Medical Center, 13 December 1955, discontinued all returned provisional units as of 14 December. The remainder of the reporting period was spent on ATFA equipment organization, cleaning, and return.During December 1955, a part of the 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) was preparing for departure in January 1956 for Alaska to participate in Exercise Moose Horn. Effort was being made to properly equip this element for the maneuver.New H-19D aircraft were received by both the 57th and the 82d Medical Detachments beginning in August 1956, with the final aircraft received in the latter part of December. Since the 57th and 82d shared a hanger at Brooks Air Force Base, the 57th painted a circular white background for the red cross on the noses of their aircraft, while the 82d used a square background.In 1957, the 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) was assigned to the Office of the Surgeon General, further assigned to Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, Texas for operational control, further assigned to the 67th Medical Group for administration and training and attached to Brooks Air Force Base for rations and quarters. Fort George G. Meade, Maryland. In October 1957, after hearing rumors all summer, the 57th received a message alerting the unit for a permanent change of station move to Fort George G. Meade, Maryland. On 17 October the movement directive was received and on 30 October the movement order was published by Brooke Army Medical Center.  On 5 November the advanced party departed for Fort Meade by private auto.  Upon arrival at Fort Meade, the advance party carried out the necessary details prior to the arrival of the detachment's main body. The main body arrived at Fort Meade on 20 November 1957 with the helicopters arriving on 20 November.  The aircraft were ferried by other pilots within BAMC.  The unit, upon arrival at Fort Meade, remained assigned to the Office of the Surgeon General, attached to the Second United States Army, further attached to Fort Meade, and then further attached to the 68th Medical Group. The mission of the detachment remained training with a secondary mission of supporting Second Army in emergency medical helicopter evacuations.On 15 February 1968, one of the largest snowstorms in years fell in the DC-Baltimore metropolitan area. Requests for emergency evacuations began coming in shortly after it appeared that the snowfall was to be heavy and that it was bogging down normal transportation facilities. No missions, however, were flown until 18 February 1958. On 17 February Second Army put an emergency plan into effect which placed all pilots, crews and aircraft under their operational control. The missions flown were as follows:. 18 February 1958 - Evacuated 2 pregnant women, one from a farmhouse north of Gaithersburg, Maryland, the other from a farmhouse near Bealsville, Maryland to the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. Total flight time - 02:15. 18 February 1958 - Flew 20 cases of five-in-one rations to Fort Detrick, Maryland from Fort Meade. From Fort Detrick flew to Woodbine, Maryland and evacuated a pregnant woman back to Ft. Detrick. Total flight time - 03:05. 18 February 1958 - Evacuated 2 patients, both from farmhouses near Chestertown, Maryland to Chestertown Airfield. Total flight time - 02:30. 18 February 1958 - Evacuated patient from Bozeman, Maryland to Easton, Maryland.  Total flight time - 03:20. 19 February 1958 - Evacuated patient from Lewisdale, Maryland to hospital at Laytonsville, Maryland. Total flight time - 03:10. 19 February 1958 - Evacuated patient from Sugar Loaf Mountain to Fredrick, Maryland. Total flight time - 02:20. 19 February 1958 - Delivered fuel to farmhouse near Savage, Maryland. Total flight time - 00:30. 19 February 1958 - Delivered fuel to farmhouse near Savage, Maryland. Total flight time - 00:45. 21 February 1958 - Flew 4 photographers to Crystal Beach, Maryland to photograph another mission, Total flight time - 03:30. 22 February 1958 - Evacuated patient from Smith Island, Maryland to Crisfield Airfield, Maryland. Total flight time - 04:00. 23 February 1958 - Flew to Chestertown, Maryland to search for 2 lost boys. Bodies of 2 drowned boys were found at Panama by boats. Bodies flown from Panama back to Chestertown. Total flight time - 02:30The detachment came off of alert status on 26 February 1958 and resumed normal duties. The detachment also participated in 68th Medical Group exercises from 4 February to 7 February, evacuating simulated casualties and setting up operations in the field.On 23 March another big snow crippled the northeast sector of the country, however the roads were readily cleared. The detachment was put on stand-by alert for medical evacuation, but none materialized.On 23 March one aircraft flew power lines for the Philadelphia Electric Company around the Coatesville, Pennsylvania area carrying company personnel who were checking for downed power lines.One helicopter was dispatched on 17 July 1958 to support the 338th Medical Group at Fort Meade. It was used for simulated medical evacuations and orientation flights.An H-19 was sent to Fort Lee, Virginia on 24 July 1958 to orient reserve personnel on temporary active duty from the 300th Field Hospital. A simulated evacuation and orientation rides were given. A static display of aircraft and a simulated evacuation were shown to Reserve Officers' Training Corps cadets visiting Fort Meade on 31 July 1958.A lecture was given to personnel of the 314th Station Hospital at Fort Lee, Virginia on 21 August 1958. A simulated evacuation and orientation rides were given, Normal unit missions completed the month.On 25 September 1958, a mission of a rather unusual nature was accomplished in an H-19. The Maryland Fish and Game Commission requested that the 57th fly a tubful of live fish from Rock Hall, Maryland to Deep Creek Lake in western Maryland. A noncommissioned officer sat in the \"hole\" with the fish and dropped oxygen tablets in the water, but to no avail.  Of the forty striped bass netted from the Chesapeake Bay, only 4 were alive at the conclusion of the flight.  This was the first, and probably last, time fish had been transported in this manner.On 21 September the 57th went on an overnight field problem on the Fort Meade reservation. The new heliport lighting system was tested for the first time and after quite a bit of practice and resetting the equipment, landings were being made at night quite accurately.On 7 October, one H-19 was sent to\tFort A. P. Hill, Virginia to act on a stand-by basis for possible casualties resulting from field exercises. The 79th Engineer Group and the 13th Field Hospital were practicing field problems prior to taking their Army Training Tests. The 57th had one helicopter on a stand-by basis from 7 October to 25 October 1958, but only one minor casualty resulted and was the only helicopter evacuation. The helicopter did carry a doctor daily on sick call trips and made a few reconnaissance missions.A flight of two helicopters left Fort Meade on 24 November 1958 to make a proficiency cross-country flight to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The pilots also compared notes on units with their counterparts at Fort Bragg. The flight returned the next day to Fort Meade.An evacuation flight was accomplished on 6 December 1958. An Army Lieutenant Colonel and his family were in volved in an auto accident at Pulaski, West Virginia and placed in the civilian hospital there. A nurse from the Fort Meade Hospital accompanied the flight. The helicopter arrived back at Fort Meade at 1915 hours with Lieutenant Colonel and his wife, where an ambulance brought them to the Fort Meade Hospital. Total flight time logged that day was 07:35 hours.On 10 December 1958 a Tuberculosis patient was flown from the Fort Meade Hospital to Valley Forge General Hospital.The month of January 1959 proved to be quite uneventful until 2000 hours on the 27th.  At that time the detachment commander received a call at home from the Second Army Aviation Section. The detachment was requested to leave the next morning for Meadeville, Pennsylvania to fly a demolition team, equipment, photographers and the Second Army Public Information Officer. An ice jam on French Creek was threatening to flood the town if another rainfall fell. Meadeville had been crippled by a flood two days before causing $5 million worth of damage. The flood waters had receded, but unless the ice could be blasted from the creek the town would be flooded all over again. Three of the unit's H-19s departed Fort Meade at 0845 hours, 28 January 1959 with six demolition men from the 19th Engineer Battalion, two photographers from the 67th Signal Battalion and the Second Army Public Information Office. Also on the flight were three crew chiefs, and six pilots, one of whom was borrowed from the 36th Evacuation Hospital since the detachment had only five pilots present for duty.  The flight of three arrived at Meadeville at 1400 hours and was met at the airfield by the Reserve Advisors for the area, one of whom was made chief of the ice blasting operations.  A reconnaissance flight was made of the ice at 1630 hours that afternoon and the next day, blasting operations began. Reinforcements were brought up via bus from the 19th Engineer Battalion to aid in blasting. The primary duty of the H-19s was to reconnoiter the area and during the last few days to carry 540-pound loads of TNT and drop if from a hover to the demolition team on the ice.  The detachment also carried the teams to the ice in inaccessible areas. Cn 9 February the operation was considered accomplished, and the detachment's helicopters were released.  One helicopter had been released on the 2nd of February and returned to Fort Meade. Weather kept the remaining party from leaving until 11 February. One aircraft had to remain at Meadville because of engine failure during warm-up.Two pilots flew one of the detachment's aircraft to Atlanta, Georgia for major overhaul. They stopped at Fort Benning, Georgia on the way for a tête-à-tête with the 37th Medical Battalion. On 17 April 1959 the detachment had one medical evacuation from Fort Meade to Valley Forge General Hospital.In May 1959 the detachment flew an evacuation from Fort Belvoir to Walter Reed Army Medical Center.\tA Second Army L-20 picked-up the patient at Nassawadox, Virginia and flew him to Ft Belvoir where he was transferred to a waiting H-19.The detachment flew one aircraft to Atlantic City, New Jersey for 4 days Temporary Duty in conjunction with the American Medical Association Convention and one aircraft to Atlanta, Georgia for SCAMP in June 1959.On 6 July 1959, the detachment used one aircraft to fly medical supplies to Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania on an emergency run. The detachment also flew one aircraft to Fort Indiantown Gap Pennsylvania to put on a demonstration for the reserve troops in summer training in July.On 12 August 1959 the detachment sent one aircraft to Bradford, Pennsylvania to pick-up an Army officer injured in an auto accident. He was flown to Fort Meade and transferred to the hospital. Another aircraft spent 3 days at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania carrying an inspection team to Nike sites.On 18 August 1959 A Navy family member was evacuated from Bainbridge Naval Center to Bethesda Naval Hospital. The patient had a growth in her throat and could hardly breathe. The Naval doctor accompanying the flight almost had to perform a tracheotomy in the air, but the patient recovered her breathe and made it to the hospital.On 21 August 1959 the detachment evacuated one patient to Valley Forge General Hospital. This was the same patient brought to Fort Meade from Bradford, Pennsylvania on 12 August.Medical evacuations increased in September 1959 when a scheduled evacuation run from Carlisle Barracks to Valley Forge General Hospital was initiated - a total of 9 patients were transported this month.In October 1959, the detachment evacuated a patient with an injured kidney from Chestertown, Maryland to Fort Meade.In November 1959, flights from Carlisle Barracks to Valley Forge General Hospital were numerous during the month, with 7 patients transported.As the detachment prepared to transition from H-19s to the first air ambulance detachment to field the HU-1, 1LT John P. Temperilli Jr. returned from the HU-1A Maintenance Course at Fort Worth, Texas and 1LT Paul A. Bloomquist departed for the same course.Evacuations for the December 1959 decreased, with only 3 patients transported during the month.Two crews departed for Fort Worth, Texas to pick-up two HU-1As (Tail numbers 58-3022 & 58–3023), they departed Fort Worth on 11 January 1960 to return to Fort Meade HU-1A #3123 developed frost pump trouble in Charlotte, North Carolina.One crew departed for Fort Worth to pick-up HU-1A tail number 58-3024 and departed Fort Worth for Fort Meade on 21 January 1960.Two crews departed Fort Worth with HU-1As (Tail numbers 58-3025 and 58–3026) on 26 Jan 60. As of the end of January 1960, the 57th had 5 HU-1As and 4 H-19Ds assigned to the unit.On 17 February 1960 the detachment performed an emergency evacuation from Bainbridge to Bethesda Naval Hospital. It ended up that 3 aircraft were involved - 1 H-19 and 2 HU-1As. Check-outs began in the HU-1As. Three pilots soloed in the UH-1 during the month, and on 18 February one pilot set a record on time to return to Fort Meade from Felker Army Airfield, 03:35 in two days. This extended time was due to weather - a 40 knot head wind.On 29 February 1960, the detachment set out for the field.  Just prior to completing the tent pitching, the field problem was called off because HU-1A #3024 had a material failure. No injuries were incurred. Damage was $60,000 and probably a new aircraft to replace # 58–3024.On 5 March the unit started on a routine evacuation mission which turned into a snow emergency at Cambridge, Maryland. Many hours were flown and much rescuing was accomplished.On 23 March 1960 at 0230 hours the detachment received a call to proceed to Elkins, West Virginia to help search for a downed Air Force plane, Two H-19s left at 0600 that morning. The aircraft was found, but all aboard were killed on impact.On 30 April, First Lieutenant Bloomquist and Captain Temperilli had the pleasure of flying General Ridgway in the HU-1A. He was impressed.In May, the unit was alerted to depart for Chile to assist in the disaster caused by an earthquake. All personnel except a rear detachment of one officer and two enlisted deployed with four of the detachment's HU-1As.The operation in Chile and the detachment returned home on 25 June 1960.The 57th Medical Detachment was reorganized and redesignated as the 57th Medical Platoon effective 1 July 1960.One aircraft and crew participated in TRIPHIBOUS OPERATION at Fort Story, Virginia; demonstrating a simulated medevac to a ship.The 57th Medical Platoon was redesignated the 57th Medical Detachment on 10 March 1961.In December 1961 the detachment was notified that it would be participating in an exercise in Asia, but before it deployed, the 82d Medical Detachment was substituted for the 57th, and deployed on Exercise Great Shelf in the Philippines in March 1962. Operations in Vietnam, 1962–1973. Advisory support, 1962–1964. The 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) received its final alert for overseas deployment on 15 February 1962.Unit aircraft, one officer and five enlisted departed Fort George G. Meade, Maryland on 3 March 1962 for the Brookley Ocean Terminal in Mobile, Alabama. While in Mobile, the detachment's aircraft were processed for overseas shipment, loaded aboard the USNS Crotan, and arrived at Saigon on 20 April 1962.Yellow disk TAT equipment and two enlisted departed Fort Meade on 16 April 1962 and arrived in Saigon on 20 April 1962.The main body of the 57th's personnel departed Fort Meade on 18 April 1962 and arrived at Nha Trang just before noon on 26 April 1962.The 57th Medical Detachment became operational at Nha Trang on 5 May 1962 when aircraft and fuel became available.Aircraft were split to station three at Nha Trang and two at Qui Nhon. The detachment did not become operational at Qui Nhon until fuel became available on the 12 June 1962. Lack of information and preparedness when segments of the detachment arrived in South Vietnam was the main reason why operational capability could not be reached sooner than indicated. Contributing factors were a lack of fuel for the aircraft and differences in operational concept as set forth by Letter of Instructions, Headquarters, U.S. Army Support Group, Vietnam, dated 24 April 1962, and those set forth by the detachment commander.The concept of operations as of the end of July 1962, a 3–2 split of aircraft with supporting personnel was feasible and was being carried out with minor difficulties that could be resolved at the detachment level. A major problem area was the lack of adequate communications. The unit's primary mission of on call Emergency Aeromedical Evacuation could not function properly unless the information on where casualties were located could be relayed to the unit so that a response could be immediate relative to personnel becoming casualties.No real estate was provided for setting up the detachment at Nha Trang Air Base. The detachment acquired its own real estate but still did not have construction for performing maintenance on organic aircraft. As of the end of July 1962, all supplies were under canvas or in Conex containers. Aircraft maintenance was performed in the open and when inclement weather arrived, maintenance ceased, as has been the case when changing three component parts of the aircraft in June 1962.Requests for action were slow and in one instance had a demoralizing effect on personnel. The request for flight status on one enlisted performing hazardous duty from the time the unit arrived had not been received as of the end of July 1962.As of 1 October 1962, a lack of logistical support effected the overall operational capability of the detachment. This was further aggravated by being split into two locations. As of 1 October 1962 it was felt that the need existed for such a split, but unless logistical support for aircraft was improved, some consideration would have to be given to employing the detachment in one location to maintain 24-hour operational capability.As of 1 October 1962, the detachment was authorized five aircraft and had four assigned: Aircraft 58-2081 was EDP for 20 items. Time until the aircraft would become flyable was unknown.. Aircraft 58-3022 was crash damaged, and the time until the aircraft would be replaced was unknown.. Aircraft 58-3023 was flyable but would be grounded in 45 hours flying time for two items.. Aircraft 58-3026 was flyable but would be grounded in 23 flying hours for a tail rotor hub assembly.. Aircraft 58-3055 would be grounded in 6 flying hours for a tail rotor hub assembly. The part had been extended and could not be extended further.The detachment was housed in tentage at the airfield without adequate facilities for storing supplies or performing maintenance. Coordination with Nha Trang Airbase Commander had been made and a site for a permanent hanger type building had been approved. As of 1 October 1962, a request and recommended plans had been submitted but the status was unknown to the 57th.The detachment was completely non-operational from 17 November to 14 December 1962. This situation was caused by the turn-in of certain aircraft parts for use by another unit. Until 17 November 1962, the detachment had maintained one aircraft at Nha Trang and one aircraft at Qui Nhon. From 14 November 1962 thru the end of the year the detachment had one aircraft flyable, and it was rotated between the two locations.As of 31 December 1962, the detachment was authorized five aircraft, assigned four aircraft, and had one aircraft flyable. The aircraft status by tail number was:. Aircraft 50-2081: Prepared for shipment to the continental United States. Aircraft 50-3023: Prepared for shipment to the continental United States. Aircraft 58-3026: Prepared for shipment to the continental United States. Aircraft 58-3035: FlyableIn early November 1962, the detachment orderly room was moved into a bamboo hut which allowed for more room and ease of working conditions than was afforded by a General-Purpose medium tent. The unit supply was still housed in two GP medium tents which did not provide a good working atmosphere nor acceptable security or storage of unit equipment. No further information on the construction of a hangar and other additional workspace for the detachment was available as of 31 December 1962.. The 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) had the mission of aeromedical evacuation in support of United States Armed Forces operations in the Republic of Vietnam. This rather vague and all-encompassing definition gave rise to many questions throughout the country as to who exactly would be evacuated and in what priority.  The situation was finally clarified on 4 September 1963 with the publication of United States Army Support Group, Vietnam Regulation 59–1. The regulation established the priority as: U.S. military and civilian personnel; members of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Vietnam; and other personnel for humanitarian reasons. This same regulation also established the procedures to be followed for requesting aeromedical evacuation using a standardized nine-line medical evacuation request.Towards the end of 1963 the fruits of this regulation became apparent as a definite standardized procedure evolved from the positive application of the regulation.This left the 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) responsible for aeromedical evacuation in the II, III and IV Corps Tactical Zones within the limits of USASGV Regulation 59–1, while the United States Marine Corps was responsible for aeromedical evacuation within the I Corps Tactical Zone.The detachment was organized under Table of Organization and Equipment 8-500C with Change 2. The authorized strength of the detachment was 7 officers and 22 enlisted. The Commanding General of the U.S. Army Support Group, Vietnam authorized an increase in unit strength from 7 to 10 officers. This was due to the requirement to have two aviators per aircraft when flying in the Republic of Vietnam. A request to modify the unit TO&E had also been submitted.Beginning in late January 1963, operational support was provided from three separate bases in the country.  The headquarters section with three aircraft was located at Tan Son Nhut Airbase in Saigon. Another section was located in the seacoast town of Qui Nhon with one aircraft, while the third section was located inland of Qui Nhon at Pleiku in the central highlands.The headquarters section supported operations in the III and IV Corps Tactical Zones, while operations in the II Corps Tactical Zone was provided by the sections in Qui Nhon and Pleiku. The two separate locations in the II Corps Tactical Zone were required due to the large geographic area and the rugged mountains in the highlands.  The relocation of aircraft was required due to increased Viet Cong activity in the IV Corps Tactical Zone.in March 1963, a changeover of the detachment's aircraft occurred, with the unit's UH-1As being replaced with UH-1Bs.The unit remained assigned to the 8th Field Hospital and under the operational control of the U.S. Army Support Group, Vietnam.The detachment operated at under TOE strength until April, when an Infantry officer was assigned to augment the crew at Qui Nhon.In June, that officer was released and three new officers from the Combat arms were assigned on Verbal Orders of the Commanding General, U.S. Army Support Command, Vietnam to bring the detachment's total officer strength to ten. One was an Infantry officer, the second an Armor officer, and the third a Warrant Officer aviator.In October the Warrant Officer rotated home and was replaced by an Armor officer.Throughout 1963, the enlisted strength of the detachment hovered around the TO&E authorized strength of 23.Extensive scheduled training operations as understood in most army circles were not included in the detachment's yearly plan from the time they began operations in 1962 until they began training the Republic of Vietnam Air Force in Medical Evacuation Operations in 1970. There were two basic reasons for this. First, the realization that the entire deployment in Vietnam was a continual practical exercise, and second the desire to keep non-essential flights to an absolute minimum. Training focused on pilot and crew preparation and certification for their duties, such as Pilot in Command, Instructor Pilot, and so on, or training in new systems.Maintenance support for the detachment's organic aircraft remained above the army's stated minimum goal of 68% aircraft availability during 1963, despite the detachment's heavy workload of 2,094 flying hours for the year. This was especially significant since the detachment was designed to operate from one location but was operating from three for the majority of the year. Close coordination with field maintenance units at the locations where aircraft were stationed through the headquarters section at Tan Son Nhut was a dominant factor in maintaining this achievement. However, the crux of all maintenance support rested with the detachment itself and this was where the problems had to be resolved. A heavy work schedule was maintained to keep as many aircraft as possible available for flight. The major burden fell on the two single-ship sections.Requests for aeromedical evacuation were channeled through both Army (Combat Operations Center) and Air Force (Air Operations Center) communications systems to the 57th Medical Detachment as directed in USASGV Regulation 59–1. Action on these requests then became the responsibility of the commanding officer of the 57th Medical Detachment.Requests for aeromedical coverage on airmobile assault operations were forwarded directly from the requesting unit to the 57th Medical Detachment, and the 57th's detachment commander would coordinate with the assaulting unit's chain of command on the mission. The 57th Medical Detachment had, upon request, covered every major operation in the Republic of Vietnam. This coverage was provided by sending one aircraft to the staging area to the assault staging area to either fly with the assault unit or stand by in the staging area. This made immediate response in the area of the assault possible.During 1963, night medical evacuation had become a regular service of the detachment and by the end of the year was considered its forte. Due to both the detachment's experience and willingness to fly at night most requests for night evacuations came straight to the detachment. An aircraft and crew—a pilot in command, pilot, crew chief, and medic—at all three locations was continually made available for night operations.Since it was the detachment's policy to accept all legitimate requests for aeromedical evacuation whether day or night, the unit was, de facto, available for aeromedical evacuations on a 24-hour basis.Major evacuation for U.S. casualties was provided in the Saigon area. These patients were brought directly to the Tan Son Nhut airfield whenever feasible. On assault operation coverage, medical aid was usually first administered to the casualty by the Medical Corps officer that accompanied the assaulting unit into the staging area.Vietnamese casualties were usually transported to the nearest field hospital. If further evacuation to the rear was requested by Vietnamese medical personnel and was not contrary to USASCV Regulation 59–1, the request was honored.Patient care as provided by the 57th Medical Detachment in 1963 consisted mainly of in-flight and emergency medical treatment. Many times, this treatment was the very first the casualty received and consequently turned out to be a definite lifesaving step. The flight medic also provided limited first aid to patients waiting in the staging areas for further rearward evacuation when time permitted.Throughout the war, although medical evacuation of patients constituted the major workload for the detachment, there were considerable missions in other areas. Aeromedical evacuation helicopters provided coverage for armed and troop transport helicopters during combat heliborne assaults, U.S. Air Force defoliation missions, training parachute jumps, convoys of troop and equipment carrying vehicles, and transport of key medical personnel and emergency medical material.Of the many problems evolving from the operation of any unit, there is one that usually stands before all others. The foible that plagued the 57th Medical Detachment was that of providing total aeromedical coverage to both American and Vietnamese combatants and noncombatants in the Republic of Vietnam. Although the Vietnamese were responsible for evacuating their own casualties, many contingencies came into play that prevented them from doing so, such as large numbers of casualties, lack of sufficient aircraft, or large areas to be covered. To better enable the 57th Medical Detachment to provide this vital coverage, it was necessary to split the unit into three operational sections. This resulted in coverage of a greater area, but also resulted in reduced coverage in Saigon and areas further South. However, this was regarded as the lesser of the two operational constraints.This then was the nature of the problem. As evacuation assets were arrayed in 1963, many of the aviation companies were forced to provide tactical aircraft to supplement aeromedical aircraft whenever helicopter ambulances of the 57th Medical Detachment were not available due to either prior commitments or the restrictions imposed by aircraft maintenance. This condition would be relieved to a great extent by the augmentation of another helicopter ambulance unit. At the end of 1963 a study was in preparation by the United States Army Support Group, Vietnam to evaluate such a proposal.Another area that caused problems for the 57th Medical Detachment in 1963 was the matter of having to justify the unit's existence to higher headquarters on the basis of yearly flying hours. This was interpreted by the 57th to mean that a unit's worth was solely dependent on the number of hours flown in a given period and not in the actual accomplishments of the unit—for example, the number of patients evacuated or lives saved. This demonstrated that some individuals did not fully understand the real value of having a trained aeromedical evacuation unit available for immediate response to evacuation requests. Since the detachment performed missions for medical evacuation only, the yearly flight time on aircraft depended solely on the number of evacuations requested. Unlike other aviation units, no administrative or logistical missions were performed, and consequently, the detachment's flight time was less than most other units then serving in the Republic of Vietnam. Because of this shortcoming, another study was directed by the U.S. Support Group, Vietnam to determine the feasibility of integrating the 57th Medical Detachment with those of other logistical units for the purpose on increasing its effectiveness.The last problem area identified in 1963 that was worth of mention was that concerning maintenance. As mentioned above, the problem was a result of operating from three distinct sections at Qui Nhon, Pleiku, and Saigon. To maintain a flyable aircraft at all times in all sections required more man hours than if the aircraft were concentrated in one location. Thus, a heavier than normal schedule was required by the maintenance personnel at all locations. Despite this, at times no amount of manpower could an aircraft flyable and in this case another aircraft would have to be borrowed from a unit in the immediate vicinity, The limitations on this type of arrangement are readily apparent. The detachment's recommended solution was the deployment of a second air ambulance detachment to Vietnam and the concentration of the 57th's aircraft at one location.During its first year in country, the 57th worked without a tactical call sign, simply using \"Army\" and the tail number of the aircraft. For example, if a pilot were flying a helicopter with the serial number 62-12345, his call sign would be \"Army 12345\". The 57th communicated internally on any vacant frequency it could find. Major Lloyd Spencer, the 57th's second detachment commander in Vietnam, decided that this improvised system needed to be replaced by something more formal. He visited the Navy Support Activity, Saigon, which controlled all the call signs in South Vietnam. He received a Signal Operations Instructions book that listed all the unused call signs. Most, like \"Bandit\", were more suitable for assault units than for medical evacuation units. But one entry, \"Dust Off\", epitomized the 57th's medical evacuation missions. Since the countryside then was dry and dusty, helicopter pickups in the fields often blew dust, dirt, blankets, and shelter halves all over the men on the ground. By adopting \"Dust Off\", Spencer found for Army aeromedical evacuation in Vietnam a name that lasted the rest of the war.: 29 Although unit callsigns at the time were rotated periodically to preserve operations security, it was determined that having a fixed callsign for medical evacuation—and a fixed frequency—would be more advantageous for medical evacuation operations, and so the 57th's callsign was not changed as it normally would have been at the end of the period for the Signal Operations Instructions.. January 1964 found the 57th Medical Detachment located at Tan Son Nhut airport, Saigon. Two air ambulances and crews were attached to the 52d Aviation Battalion, with one helicopter and crew each located at Pleiku and Qui Nhon to provide aeromedical evacuation support within the II Corps area. The remaining three air ambulances and personnel were attached to the 45th Transportation Battalion at Tan Son Nhut providing aeromedical evacuation support within the III and IV Corps areas.The mission of the detachment was to provide aeromedical evacuation support to U.S. Forces in the Republic of Vietnam and aeromedical evacuation assistance to the Republic of Vietnam as requested. Before the month of January ended the unit was detached from the 145th Aviation Battalion (previously the 45th Transportation Battalion) and attached to Headquarters Detachment, United States Army Support Group, Vietnam. As a result of the new attachment to Headquarters Detachment, U.S. Army Support Group, Vietnam, the unit enlisted personnel moved into new quarters in the Support Group Compound.During the latter part of February consideration was given to relocating the Flight Section in the II Corps area to the IV Corps area because of increased activity in the lower Mekong Delta. This trend of increased activity in IV Corps continued and consequently on 1 March, Detachment A, 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance), (Provisional), was organized and stationed at Sóc Trăng Airfield  with attachment to the Delta Aviation Battalion. This reorganization and relocation placed two aircraft with crews in Soc Trang with the remaining aircraft and personnel located at Tan Son Nhut. A sharp increase in the number of patients evacuated during the month of March demonstrated that the relocation was well justified. The increase of patients evacuated in March initiated an upward trend that reached a peak in July with 768 patients evacuated.With the upward trend in flight time, patients evacuated, and missions flown there was also a corresponding undesirable upward trend in the number of aircraft hit by enemy fire. On 3 April 1964, First Lieutenant Brian Conway had the dubious distinction of being the first Medical Service Corp Aviator to be wounded in action in Vietnam. A .30-caliber round passed through his ankle as he terminated an approach into a field location for a patient pick-up. This wound resulted in Lt. Conway's evacuation to the United States.Other statistics which reflected an upward trend during the spring and early summer of 1964 were night flying time and missions. The evacuation of patients at night became routine. These missions were accomplished with a single helicopter flying blackout. It was interesting to note that throughout the entire year, only one hit was received at night although searching fire was often observed. Much of the success of the detachment's night operations was due to the excellent U.S. Air Force radar coverage of the III and IV Corps area. Paris and Paddy Control consistently placed unit aircraft over the target.Although the number of Vietnamese casualties rose in 1963, the South Vietnamese military refused to set up its own aeromedical evacuation unit. The VNAF response to requests for medical evacuation depended on aircraft availability, the security of the landing zone, and the mood and temperament of the VNAF pilots. If the South Vietnamese had no on-duty or standby aircraft ready to fly a medical evacuation mission, they passed the request on to the 57th.  Even when they accepted the mission themselves, their response usually suffered from a lack of leadership and poor organization. Since South Vietnamese air mission commanders rarely flew with their flights, the persons responsible for deciding whether to abort a mission often lacked the requisite experience. As a MACV summary said: \"Usually the decision was made to abort, and the air mission commander could do nothing about it. When an aggressive pilot was in the lead ship, the aircraft came through despite the firing. American advisers reported that on two occasions only the first one or two helicopters landed; the rest hovered out of reach of the wounded who needed to get aboard.\"An example of the poor quality of VNAF medical evacuation occurred in late October 1963, when the ARVN 2d Battalion, 14th Regiment, conducted Operation LONG HUU II near O Lac in the Delta. At dawn the battalion began its advance. Shortly after they moved out, the Viet Cong ambushed them, opening fire from three sides with automatic weapons and 81 -mm. mortars. At 0700 casualty reports started coming into the battalion command post. The battalion commander sent his first casualty report to the regimental headquarters at 0800: one ARVN soldier dead and twelve wounded, with more casualties in the paddies. He then requested medical evacuation helicopters. By 0845 the casualty count had risen to seventeen lightly wounded, fourteen seriously wounded, and four dead. He sent out another urgent call for helicopters. The battalion executive officer and the American adviser prepared two landing zones, one marked by green smoke for the seriously wounded and a second by yellow smoke for the less seriously wounded. Not until 1215 did three VNAF H-34's arrive over O Lac to carry out the wounded and dead. During the delay the ARVN battalion stayed in place to protect their casualties rather than pursue the retreating enemy. The American adviser wrote later: \"It is common that, when casualties are sustained, the advance halts while awaiting evacuation. Either the reaction time for helicopter evacuation must be improved, or some plan must be made for troops in the battalion rear to provide security for the evacuation and care of casualties.\"The ARVN medical services also proved inadequate to handle the large numbers of casualties. In the Delta, ARVN patients were usually taken to the Vietnamese Provincial Hospital at Can Tho. As the main treatment center for the Delta, it often had a backlog of patients. At night only one doctor was on duty, for the ARVN medical service lacked physicians. If Dustoff flew in many casualties, that doctor normally treated as many as he could; but he rarely called in any of his fellow doctors to help. In return they would not call him on his night off. Many times at night Dustoff pilots would have to make several flights into Can Tho. On return flights the pilots often found loads of injured ARVN soldiers lying on the landing pad where they had been left some hours earlier. After several such flights few pilots could sustain any enthusiasm for night missions.Another problem was that the ARVN officers sometimes bowed to the sentiments of their soldiers, many of whom believed that the soul lingers between this world and the next if the body is not properly buried. They insisted that Dustoff ships fly out dead bodies, especially if there were no seriously wounded waiting for treatment. Once, after landing at a pickup site north of Saigon, a Dustoff crew saw many ARVN wounded lying on the ground. But the other ARVN soldiers brought bodies to the helicopter to be evacuated first. As the soldiers loaded the dead in one side of the ship, a Dustoff medical corpsman pulled the bodies out the other side. The pilot stepped out of the helicopter to explain in halting French to the ARVN commander that his orders were to carry out only the wounded. But an ARVN soldier manning a .50-caliber machine gun on a nearby armored personnel carrier suddenly pointed his weapon at the Huey. This convinced the Dustoff crew to fly out the bodies. They carried out one load but did not return for another.Early in 1964 the growing burden of aeromedical evacuation fell on the 57th's third group of new pilots, crews, and maintenance personnel. The helicopters were still the 1963 UH-1B models, but most of the new pilots were fresh from flight school. Kelly was described as \"a gruff, stubborn, dedicated soldier who let few obstacles prevent him from finishing a task.\" Within six months he set an example of courage and hard work that Dustoff pilots emulated for the rest of the war, and into the 21st Century.Kelly quickly took advantage of the 57th's belated move to the fighting in the south. On 1 March 1964 the U.S. Army Support Group, Vietnam ordered the aircraft at Pleiku and Qui Nhon to move to the Delta. Two helicopters and five pilots, now called Detachment A, 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance), Provisional, flew to the U.S. base at Soc Trang. Once a fighter base for both the French and the Japanese, Soc Trang was a compound roughly 1,000 by 3,000 feet, surrounded by rice paddies.Unit statistics soon proved the wisdom of the move south: the number of Vietnamese evacuees climbed from 193 in February to 416 in March. Detachment A continued its coverage of combat in the Delta until October 1964, when the 82nd Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) from the States took over that area. Major Kelly, who had taken command of the 57th on 11 January, moved south with Detachment A, preferring the field and flying to ground duty in Saigon.Detachment A in Soc Trang lived in crude \"Southeast Asia\" huts with sandbags and bunkers for protection against enemy mortar and ground attack. The rest of the 57th in Saigon struggled along with air conditioning, private baths, a mess hall, and a bar in their living quarters. In spite of the contrast, most pilots preferred Soc Trang. It was there that Major Kelly and his pilots forged the Dustoff tradition of valorous and dedicated service.Kelly and his teams also benefited from two years of growing American involvement in Vietnam. By the spring of 1964 the United States had 16,000 military personnel in South Vietnam (3,700 officers and 12,300 enlisted men). The Army, which accounted for 10,100 of these, had increased its aircraft in South Vietnam from 40 in December 1961 to 370 in December 1963. For the first time since its arrival two years ago the 57th was receiving enough Dustoff requests to keep all its pilots busy.Kelly faced one big problem when he arrived: the helicopters that the 57th had received the year before were showing signs of age and use, and Brigadier General Joseph Stilwell Jr., the Support Group commander, could find no new aircraft for the detachment. Average flight time on the old UH-1Bs was 800 hours. But this did not deter the new pilots from each flying more than 100 hours a month in medical evacuations. Some of them stopped logging their flight time at 140 hours, so that the flight surgeon would not ground them for exceeding the monthly ceiling.The new team continued and even stepped-up night operations. In April 1964, the detachment flew 110 hours at night while evacuating ninety-nine patients. To aid their night missions in the Delta the pilots made a few special plotting flights, during which they sketched charts of the possible landing zones, outlined any readily identifiable terrain features, and noted whether radio navigational aid could be received. During one such flight Major Kelly and his copilot heard on their radio that a VNAF T-28, a fixed-wing plane, had gone down. After joining the search, Kelly soon located the plane. While he and his crew circled the area trying to decide how to approach the landing zone, the Viet Cong below opened fire on the helicopter. One round passed up through the open cargo door and slammed into the ceiling. Unfazed, Kelly shot a landing to the T-28, taking fire from all sides. Once down, he, his crew chief, and his medic jumped out and sprayed submachine gun fire at the Viet Cong while helping the VNAF pilot destroy his radios and pull the M60 machine guns from his plane. Kelly left the area without further damage and returned the VNAF pilot to his unit. Kelly and his Dustoff crew flew more than 500 miles that day.On 2 April one of the Detachment A crews flying to Saigon from Soc Trang received a radio call that a village northwest of them had been overrun. Flying up to the area where the Mekong River flows into South Vietnam from Cambodia, they landed at the village of Cai Cai, where during the night Viet Cong had killed or wounded all the people. Soldiers lay at their fighting positions where they had fallen, women and children where they had been shot. The Dustoff teams worked the rest of the day flying out the dead and wounded, putting two or three children on each litter.One night that spring Detachment A pilots Capt. Patrick Henry Brady] and 2d Lt. Ernest J. Sylvester were on duty when a call came in that an A1-E Skyraider, a fixed-wing plane, had gone down near the town of Rach Gia. Flying west to the site, they radioed the Air Force radar controller, who guided them to the landing zone and warned them of Viet Cong antiaircraft guns. As the Dustoff ship drew near the landing zone, which was plainly marked by the burning A1-E, the pilot of another nearby Al-E radioed that he had already knocked out the Viet Cong machine guns. But when Brady and Sylvester approached the zone the Viet Cong opened fire. Bullets crashed into the cockpit and the pilots lost control of the aircraft. Neither was seriously wounded and they managed to regain control and hurry out of the area. Viet Cong fire then brought down the second Al-E. A third arrived shortly and finally suppressed the enemy fire, allowing a second Dustoff ship from Soc Trang to land in the zone. The crew chief and medical corpsman found what they guessed was the dead pilot of the downed aircraft, then found the pilot of the second, who had bailed out, and flew him back to Soc Trang.A short time later Brady accompanied an ARVN combat assault mission near Phan Thiet, northeast of Saigon. While Brady's Dustoff ship circled out of range of enemy ground fire, the transport helicopters landed and the troops moved out into a wooded area heavily defended by the Viet Cong. The ARVN soldiers immediately suffered several casualties and called for Dustoff. Brady's aircraft took hits going into and leaving the landing zone, but he managed to fly out the wounded. In Phan Thiet, while he was assessing the damage to his aircraft, an American adviser asked him if he would take ammunition back to the embattled ARVN unit when he returned for the next load of wounded. After discussing the propriety of carrying ammunition in an aircraft marked with red crosses, Brady and his pilots decided to consider the ammunition as \"preventive medicine\" and fly it into the LZ for the ARVN troops. Back at the landing zone Brady found that Viet Cong fire had downed an L-19 observation plane. Brady ran to the crash site, but both the American pilot and the observer had been killed. The medical corpsman and crew chief pulled the bodies from the wreckage and loaded them on the helicopter. Brady left the ammunition and flew out with the dead.By the time the helicopter had finished its mission and returned to Tan Son Nhut, most of the 57th were waiting. News of an American death traveled quickly in those early days of the war. Later, reflecting on the incident, Kelly praised his pilots for bringing the bodies back even though the 57th's mission statement said nothing about moving the dead. But he voiced renewed doubts about the ferrying of ammunition.Brady later explained what actually happened behind the scenes. Upon landing, Brady was met by Kelly and called aside. Expecting to be sternly counseled, Brady was surprised when Kelly simply asked why he had carried in ammunition and carried out the dead. Brady replied that the ammunition was \"preventive medicine\" and that the dead \"were angels\", and he couldn't refuse them. Kelly simply walked back to the group involved in that day's missions and told them that it was the type of mission he wanted the 57th to be flying.  Brady realized the significance of Kelly's statement, as Kelly would be responsible for any fallout from Brady's actions.In fact, the Dustoff mission was again under attack. When Support Command began to pressure the 57th to place removable red crosses on the aircraft and begin accepting general purpose missions, Kelly stepped up unit operations. Knowing that removable red crosses had already been placed on transport and assault helicopters in the north, Kelly told his men that the 57th must prove its worth-and by implication the value of dedicated medical helicopters-beyond any shadow of doubt.While before the 57th had flown missions only in response to a request, it now began to seek missions. Kelly himself flew almost every night. As dusk came, he and his crew would depart Soc Trang and head southwest for the marshes and Bac Lieu, home of a team from the 73d Aviation Company and detachments from two signal units, then further south to Ca Mau, an old haunt of the Viet Minh, whom the French had never been able to dislodge from its forested swamps. Next, they would fly south almost to the tip of Ca Mau Peninsula, then at Nam Can reverse their course toward the Seven Canals area. After a check for casualties there at Vi Thanh, they turned northwest up to Rach Gia on the Gulf of Siam, then on to the Seven Mountains region on the Cambodian border. From there they came back to Can Tho, the home of fourteen small American units, then up to Vinh Long on the Mekong River, home of the 114th Aviation Company (Airmobile Light). Finally, they flew due east to Truc Giang, south to the few American advisers at Phu Vinh, then home to Soc Trang. The entire circuit was 720 kilometers.If any of the stops had patients to be evacuated, Kelly's crew loaded them on the aircraft and continued on course, unless a patient's condition warranted returning immediately to Soc Trang. After delivering the patients, they would sometimes resume the circuit. Many nights they carried ten to fifteen patients who otherwise would have had to wait until daylight to receive the care they needed. In March, this flying from outpost to outpost, known as \"scarfing\", resulted in seventy-four hours of night flying that evacuated nearly one-fourth of that month's 448 evacuees. The stratagem worked; General Stilwell dropped the idea of having the 57th use removable red crosses.Although most of Dustoff's work in the Delta was over flat, marshy land, Detachment A sometimes had to work the difficult mountainous areas near the Cambodian border. Late on the afternoon of 11 April Kelly received a mission request to evacuate two wounded ARVN soldiers from Phnom Kto Mountain of the Seven Mountains of An Giang Province. When he arrived he found that the only landing zone near the ground troops was a small area surrounded by high trees below some higher ground held by the Viet Cong. Despite the updrafts common to mountain flying, the mists, and the approaching darkness, Kelly shot an approach to the area. The enemy opened fire and kept firing until Kelly's ship dropped below the treetops into the landing zone. Kelly could set the aircraft down on only one skid; the slope was too steep. Since only one of the wounded was at the landing zone, Kelly and his crew had to balance the ship precariously while waiting for the ARVN troops to carry the other casualty up the mountain. With both patients finally on board, Kelly took off and again flew through enemy fire. The medical corpsman promptly began working on the Vietnamese, one of whom had been wounded in five places. Both casualties survived.When Kelly flew such a mission he rarely let bad weather darkness, or the enemy stop him from completing it. He fought his way to the casualties and brought them out. On one mission the enemy forced him away from the landing zone before he could place the patients on board. An hour later he tried to land exactly the same way, through enemy fire, and this time he managed to load the patients safely. The Viet Cong showed their indifference to the red crosses on the aircraft by trying to destroy it with small arms, automatic weapons, and mortars, even while the medical corpsman and crew chief loaded the patients. One round hit the main fuel drain valve and JP-4 fuel started spewing. Kelly elected to fly out anyway, practicing what he had preached since he arrived in Vietnam by putting the patients above all else and hurrying them off the battlefield. He radioed the Soc Trang tower that his ship was leaking fuel and did not have much left, and that he wanted priority on landing. The tower operator answered that Kelly had priority and asked whether he needed anything else. Kelly said, \"Yes, bring me some ice cream.\" just after he landed on the runway the engine quit, fuel tanks empty. Crash trucks surrounded the helicopter. The base commander drove up, walked over to Kelly, and handed him a quart of ice cream.Apart from the Viet Cong, the 57th's greatest problem at that time was a lack of pilots. After Kelly reached Vietnam he succeeded in having the other nine Medical Service Corps pilots who followed him assigned to the 57th. He needed more, but the Surgeon General's Aviation Branch seemed to have little understanding of the rigors of Dustoff flying. In the spring of 1964 the Aviation Branch tried to have new Medical Service Corps pilots assigned to nonmedical helicopter units in Vietnam, assuming that they would benefit more from combat training than from Dustoff flying.On 15 June 1964, Kelly gave his response:. \"As for combat experience, the pilots in this unit are getting as much or more combat-support flying experience than any unit over here. You must understand that everybody wants to get into the Aeromedical Evacuation business. To send pilots to U.T.T. [the Utility Tactical Transport Helicopter Company, a nonmedical unit] or anywhere else is playing right into their hands. I fully realize that I do not know much about the big program, but our job is evacuation of casualties from the battlefield. This we are doing day and night, without escort aircraft, and with only one ship for each mission. Since I have been here we have evacuated 1800 casualties and in the last three months we have flown 242.7 hours at night. No other unit can match this. The other [nonmedical] units fly in groups, rarely at night, and always heavily armed.\"He continued:. \"If you want the MSC Pilots to gain experience that will be worthwhile, send them to this unit. It is a Medical Unit and I don't want to see combat arms officers in this unit. I will not mention this again. However, for the good of the Medical Service Corps Pilots and the future of medical aviation I urge you to do all that you can to keep this unit full of MSC Pilots.\"In other words, Kelly thought that his unit had a unique job to do and that the only effective training for it could be found in the cockpit of a Dustoff helicopter.Perhaps presciently, Kelly closed his letter as follows:. \"Don't go to the trouble of answering this letter for I know that you are very busy. Anyhow, everything has been said. I will do my best, and please remember 'Army Medical Evacuation FIRST'.\"With more and more fighting occurring in the Delta and around Saigon, the 57th could not always honor every evacuation request. U.S. Army helicopter assault companies were forced to keep some of their aircraft on evacuation standby, but without a medical corpsman or medical equipment. Because of the shortage of Army aviators and the priority of armed combat support, the Medical Service Corps did not have enough pilots to staff another Dustoff unit in Vietnam. Most Army aeromedical evacuation units elsewhere already worked with less than their permitted number of pilots. Although Army aviation in Vietnam had grown considerably since 1961, by the summer of 1964 its resources fell short of what it needed to perform its missions, especially medical evacuation.Army commanders, however, seldom have all the men and material they can use, and Major Kelly knew that he had to do his best with what he had.Kelly had begun to realize that, although he preferred flying and being in the field to Saigon, he could better influence things by returning to Tan Son Nhut. After repeated requests from Brady, Kelly told him that he would relinquish command of Detachment A of the 57th at Soc Trang to Brady on 1 July and return to Saigon—although he then later told Brady he was extending his stay in the Delta for at least another month.. The second half of the year began with the sad event of the death of the detachment commander, Major Charles L. Kelly on 1 July 1964. He was struck in the chest by a Viet Cong bullet while attempting a patient pick-up. The aircraft crashed with the other three crewmembers receiving injuries. His dying words, \"When I have your wounded,\" would become both a creed and rallying cry for both the 57th and all other Dustoff units to follow them.. Captain Paul A. Bloomquist assumed command of the detachment and remained as commander until the arrival of Major Howard A. Huntsman Jr. on 12 August.Evacuation workload began a downward toward trend in August from the high reached in July. September showed a slight gain over August, but the trend downward continued for the remainder of the year.. Two factors were pertinent in the downward trend. First, the Vietnamese Air Force began playing an increasing role in the evacuation of Vietnamese patients. Although the evacuation of Vietnamese personnel was a secondary mission this in reality constituted the major portion of the workload for the 57th. The second factor was the arrival of the 82d Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) in October. This detachment was located in Soc Trang. This relieved Detachment A of the 57th and the unit was reconsolidated as a complete unit at Tan Son Nhut on 7 October 1964. This was the first time. that the unit had operated from one location in entirety since its arrival in Vietnam.There was a personnel exchange between the 82nd and the 57th. This involved six officers and was accomplished in order to better distribute rotation dates for the 82d Medical Detachment. Four enlisted personnel were also exchanged. Transferred from the 82d to the 57th were Captain Raymond A. Jackson, Captain Douglas E. Moore, and Lieutenant John J. McGowan. Transferred to the 82nd were Lieutenant Armond C. Simmons, Lieutenant Ernest J. Sylvester, and Lieutenant Bruce C. Zenk.In October the detachment was relieved from attachment to Headquarters Detachment, U.S. Army Support Command, Vietnam and attached to the 145th Aviation Battalion for rations and quarters. This involved a move of both officer and enlisted personnel into new quarters with the 145th Aviation Battalion. This resulted in an upgrading in living conditions which was appreciated by all.Although the evacuation of patients was to constitute the major workload for the unit, there was considerable workload in other allied areas. Aeromedical evacuation helicopters of the unit provided medical coverage for armed and troop transport helicopter during air assaults. As a result, the unit has been involved in every air mobile operation in the III Corps area, and in the IV Corps area until relieved of that responsibility by the 82nd MD (HA) in October. Medical coverage was also provided to aircraft engaged in the defoliation mission. This became almost a daily activity in the last few months of the year. Unit aircraft also became involved in many search and rescue missions. This often led to the depressing job of extracting remains from crashed aircraft.Early in the month of December unit aircraft and crews became engaged in airmobile operation and evacuation missions in the Bình Giã area which was southeast of Saigon. By the end of December operations in this area had expanded to near campaign proportions and unit aircraft were committed on nearly a daily basis. The end of the year 1964 was met with a sense of accomplishment by all unit personnel. The 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) had performed well and accomplished much. The build-up, 1965–1967. By 1965, the mission of the 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) was established as \"to provide medical air ambulance support within capabilities to U.S. and Free World Military Assistance Forces (FWMAF) personnel, and back-up service to Republic of Vietnam Air Force (VNAF) personnel as directed within III Corps Tactical Zone, ARVN 7th Division Tactical Zone within the IV Corps Tactical Zone, and back-up support for the 498th Medical Company (Air Ambulance) operating within the II Corps Tactical Zone in coordination with the Commanding Officers of the 254th and 283d Medical Detachments (Helicopter Ambulance).\" Their responsibilities included:. Providing aeromedical evacuation of patients, including in-flight treatment and/or surveillance, in accordance with established directives, from forward combat elements or medical facilities as permitted by the tactical situation to appropriate clearing stations and hospitals, and between hospitals as required.. Providing emergency movement of medical personnel and material, including blood, in support of military operations in zone.Although the units supported, and the units they coordinated with, would change from year to year, the mission remained essentially unchanged until the detachment redeployed form Vietnam in 1973.. At the end of 1965, the detachment was awaiting approval of its request to be reorganized under TO&E 8-500D which would authorize six UH-1D helicopter ambulances and a corresponding increase in aviator and enlisted personnel. The 8-500C TO&E authorized only 5 aircraft.General Order Number 75, Headquarters, 1st Logistical Command, dated 13 December 1965, organized the Medical Company (Air Ambulance) (Provisional) and assigned the new company the mission of providing command and control of the 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) in the aeromedical evacuation support of counterinsurgency operations within the III and IV Corps Tactical Zones. The company was created in response to the obvious need for a command and control headquarters.The personnel authorized under TO&E 8-500C with Change 2 was augmented by General Order Number 143, Headquarters, U.S. Army Pacific, dated 31 July 1964. This augmentation increased the unit strength by three additional Medical Service Corps Aviators, MOS 1981, which brought the total authorization for the detachment to ten aviators. This allowed the detachment to meet the command requirement that each aircraft have two aviators aboard for each flight. This was considered essential in combat flying and especially so in Vietnam in order that one aviator would be available to take control of the aircraft. in the event the other was hit by enemy fire and was not a requirement in the continental United States when the UH-1 was fielded.Under the reorganization the detachment had pending on 31 December 1965, authorized aviator personnel would increase to eight rotary wing aviators, which would have to be augmented by four additional aviators to meet the command requirement of two aviators per aircraft. A proposed TOE Unit Change Request would be submitted upon reorganization which would increase the total number of authorized. aviators to fourteen, providing for a full complement of medical evacuation pilots plus a commander and operations officer.Enlisted personnel strength remained at a satisfactory level throughout 1965, which was considered an essential factor to the accomplishment of the unit's mission. A full complement of qualified aircraft maintenance personnel and senior medical aidmen was constantly required as they participated in every evacuation flight.Aircraft maintenance support and availability of spare parts required to maintain unit aircraft in operational status was adequate, considering the increased load placed on both maintenance facilities and aircraft parts because of the influx of aviation units into Vietnam in 1965. Aircraft availability averaged 86% for the year.Air evacuation of casualties in the Republic of Vietnam was routine in 1965, as highway insecurity and frequent enemy ambushes along traveled routes prohibited evacuation by ground vehicles.The majority of aeromedical evacuations were accomplished from field locations at or near the place of injury or from forward medical clearing stations. Initial treatment of the patient was normally affected by air ambulance crew and the ground unit's medical personnel. This may have included bandaging, splinting, positioning, airway control, and the administration of a blood expander and/or pain-killer drug, as indicated. Treatment may have been rendered while in the pickup area or in the air. Crewmembers may also have had the task of assigning evacuation priorities in semi-mass casualty situations where a limited number of evacuation aircraft were available for the number of patients involved.Medical regulating for American patients had become well established with the induction of more qualified medical personnel and well-equipped installations. Patients may have been evacuated to brigade clearing stations, the 3d Surgical Hospital, 93d Evacuation Hospital, 3d Field Hospital, or the Saigon Navy Hospital as dictated by the nature of the patient's wound and patient density at a specific hospital. Coordination between the Surgeon, U.S. Army Vietnam and the Medical Regulating Officer, U.S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam effectively controlled the balance between in-country facilities.Vietnamese patients were evacuated to specific hospitals only as dictated by the initial location of the patient in relation to Saigon's Cong Hoa Hospital and a Korean surgical located in Vung Tau. Degree of injury is a factor in medical regulating for Vietnamese patients only when the patient load includes killed in action, who were taken directly to the Tan Son Nhut ARVN Cemetery.During 1965, the major workload of the unit shifted from the support of the detachment's secondary mission, which had generated the largest activity since the unit arrived in the Republic of Vietnam, to accomplishment of the primary mission, corresponding to the introduction in the Spring of large American combat units.USARPAC General Order 37, dated 25 February 1966, authorized the 57th Medical Detachment to operate under TO&E 8-500D. This authorized the detachment to augment this TO&E in three areas:. The addition of two 1/4-ton vehicles.. The substitution of the M16 rifle for the .45 cal. pistol as the new weapon used by the crew members.. The addition of six Warrant Officers.The addition of a Detachment First Sergeant proved to be invaluable. The larger UH-1D aircraft had vastly improved patient evacuation efficiency and crew safety. Carrying more patients on each flight reduced the number of patient transfers and field pick-ups otherwise required by the smaller UH-1B aircraft. Suggested changes to this TO&E were combined by the Helicopter Ambulance Detachments in the III Corps Tactical Zone and were forwarded along with justification by the 436th Medical Detachment (Company Headquarters) (Air Ambulance). A suggested change based on the 57th's recent experience would include the addition of two medical aidmen to provide backup for the six aidmen already assigned to the Helicopter Ambulance detachments. Under the then-existing personnel allocations, when one aidman was sick or on leave, the First Sergeant or an aidman from an allied unit had to fill in for him.Problems encountered or areas of concern the detachment experienced included:. Area Coverage: Supported units did not understand the concept of area coverage. This term meant that a Dustoff aircraft would respond to an emergency by proximity and speed, and not necessarily in direct support of a specific unit. At the same time, the 57th was in favor of providing as much close-in direct support as possible when the tactical situation requires it, but not at the expense of the Area Coverage concept. In previous years in Vietnam, commanders had utilized Dustoff aircraft in accordance with this Area Coverage concept. However, there was a case under consideration at the end of 1966 which challenged this concept as compared to direct individual unit coverage. The consequences of this problem area became increasingly important as more and more units arrived in South Vietnam. It would be impossible to provide every major commander with an individual Dustoff and still efficiently meet mission requirements in the country. In addition, it was felt that Dustoff operations had been highly successful in the past, and that the 57th could continue to provide a high caliber evacuation system in the future, provided evacuations continue to be administered through medical channels.Hoist Missions: The S7th Medical Detachment had equipment and trained personnel capable of performing hoist missions when required. However, problems had arisen in this area which deserve mention here. On some occasions ground commanders had requested hoist missions in areas where a suitable landing zone was close by. At other times hoist missions were requested from an area suitable for a helicopter to land in. Also, the inherent dangers of this type of operation, for the aircraft, crew, and patients could not be overemphasized. In almost all cases, it was evident that continued emphasis was needed in this area, especially by ground commanders and individual requesters.Field Standby: The 57th routinely Supplied a field standby crew for the 196th Light Infantry Brigade at Tay Ninh, and on various occasions had provided crews to the 25th Infantry Division at Cu Chi, the 1st Infantry Division at Lai Khe, and the 4th Infantry Division at Dau Tieng. This close liaison support worked well during 1965, although at times the detachment had been over committed when combat operations (i.e. Operation Attleboro, etc.) required still additional ships in addition to those already at field standby locations. With the tremendous influx of additional units into Vietnam, this field standby support area was likely to become an acute problem in the future, unless the area coverage concept was fully accepted by the supported units.Early in 1966 the 57th relocated from the Tan Son Nhut Airport to the Saigon Heliport. This move was considered temporary, pending the final move to Long Binh Post, However, this temporary category extended for more than six months and resulted in many operational restrictions within the detachment, such as back-up reaction time and muster capability. As problems mounted with the construction of a heliport at the new location, billets and other facilities at Long Binh Post were erected by individuals of the 57th. It was anticipated that the move to Long Binh would be completed by mid-January 1967, all but eliminating the many problems that arose out of operating in the highly congested city of Saigon.Aircraft maintenance support and availability of spare parts required to maintain unit aircraft in operational status was adequate, considering the increased load placed on both maintenance facilities and aircraft parts because of the continued influx of aviation units into the Republic of Vietnam. Aircraft availability average for 1966 was 80.5%General supply support continued to be a problem because of the escalating numbers of U.S. Forces introduced into the combat zone.Air evacuation of casualties in the Republic of Vietnam was routine, as general insecurity and frequent ambushes along the traveled routes prohibited evacuation by ground.The majority of aeromedical evacuations were accomplished from field locations at or near the place of injury or from forward medical clearing stations. Initial treatment of the patients were normally performed by the air ambulance crew and the ground unit's medical personnel. This may have included bandaging, splinting, positioning, airway control, application of oxygen and the administration of a blood expander and/or analgesic, as indicated. Treatment may have been rendered while in the pick-up area or in the air. Crew members may also have the task of assigning evacuation priorities in semi-mass casualty situations where limited numbers of evacuation aircraft were available for the number of patients involved.Medical regulating for U.S. patients was well established by the end of 1966. Patients may be evacuated to brigade clearing stations, Surgical Hospitals, Evacuation Hospitals, and Field Hospitals as directed by the nature of the patient's wound and the patient density at a specific hospital. Coordination between the Surgeon, U.S. Army, Vietnam and the Medical Regulating Officer, U.S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam effectively controlled the balance between in-country facilities.Vietnamese patients were evacuated to specific hospitals according to the nature of the injury, proximity of medical facilities, and as directed by initial treatment facility.During 1966, the major workload of the detachment more than doubled from the patient load generated during 1965. In November, the 57th evacuated more than 1,000 patients for the highest monthly total since arriving in country This tremendous increase in patient load directly corresponded to the increase of American units and combat operations during the year.. The 57th Medical Detachment was organized under TO&E 8-500D implemented by USARPAC General Order number 37 dated 25 February 1966. This was changed by USARPAC General Order number 218, dated 26 October 1967, authorizing the unit to operate under MTOE 8-500D.From l January to 22 October 1967 the 57th was under the command and control of the 68th Medical Group, 44th Medical Brigade. From 23 October 1967 through the end of 1967 the 57th Medical Detachment was assigned to the 67th Medical Group under the 44th Medical Brigade.Field Standby: The 57th routinely supplied a field standby crew for 3d Brigade, 25th Infantry Division at Dau Tieng in 1967. This close liaison support worked very well during 1967 and continued to do so through the end of the year. At times the detachment had been heavily committed when combat operations (for example, Operation Yellowstone, Operation Manhattan, and Operation Junction City) required aircraft in addition to those already at field standby locations.The 57th Medical Detachment successfully completed a move from the Saigon heliport to Long Binh Post in February 1967. The heliport, billets, BOQs and other facilities at Long Binh were erected by the detachment personnel.The TO&E authorization of 14 aviators was considered adequate. However, the detachment did not have more than 11 aviators assigned at any time for more than short periods. During 1967 the detachment's commitments steadily increased and with casualties and other unforeseen circumstances the assigned aviators were subjected to periods of extremely heavy workload. Although unit aviators did not accumulate high monthly total flying hours in comparison to other aviation units, the medical evacuation mission, (consisting of standby, 24 hours at a time, extensive night flying, periodic extended operations during mass casualty situations, and marginal weather) effectively limited the detachment's ability to schedule a pilot for duty on a continuous basis.The 57th Medical Detachment received 6 UH-1H aircraft in December equipped with L-13 engines. The 1400 horsepower developed by this engine proved invaluable to the detachment's crews when operating in small, confined areas in the jungle. All the aircraft were equipped with the Decca Navigator System.Aircraft maintenance support and availability of spare parts required to maintain the detachment's aircraft in operational status was adequate, considering the increased workload placed on both maintenance facilities and aircraft parts because of the influx of aviation units into the Republic of Vietnam. Aircraft availability average for 1967 was an overall 74.8%.Medical regulating of U.S. patients continued to be well established in 1967. Patients could be evacuated to brigade clearing stations, surgical hospitals, evacuation hospitals, and field hospitals, as directed by the nature of the patient's wound and the patient density at a specific hospital. Coordination between the Medical Regulating Officers of the 44th Medical Brigade and 67th Medical Group effectively controlled the balance between in-country facilities.During 1967, the increase in the patient load continued to directly correspond to the increase of American units and combat operations during the year. Sustained combat operations, 1968–1969. Effective 16 February 1968, the detachment was released from the 67th Medical Group, and assigned to the 68th Medical Group, 44th Medical Brigade, by General Order number 174, dated 14 February 1968. Also effective 16 February 1968, the detachment was attached to the 45th Medical Company (Air Ambulance); 68th Medical Group, by General Order number 17, dated 1 March 1968. The transition was carried out smoothly and without major problems.The detachment operated under TO&E 8-500D throughout most of 1968. Reorganization took place under Department of the Army General Order number 542, dated 13 September 1968, authorizing the detachment to operate under MTO&E 8-500G effective 2 October 1968. Though it was too early as of the end of 1968 to tell, no foreseeable difficulties were expected under the new TO&E.In 1968, he 57th Medical Detachment provided coverage to U.S. and Allied Forces operating within their area of responsibility which included III Corps Tactical Zone and the northern part of IV Corps Tactical Zone. The detachment provided a standby crew for its home base at Long Binh Post where it was co-located with the 45th Medical Company (Air Ambulance). In addition, it provided a permanent standby crew at Dau Tieng during the first half of the year; but lost this standby requirement and reverted to providing crews at Saigon, Tan An, Dong Tam and Phan Thiet on a rotational basis with the 45th during the last half of the year. Dustoff operations under this area support concept were extremely effective and were recognized as a tremendous morale factor to all combat troops operating in this area.The new 1968 TO&E changed the authorized Officer strength from 8 to 4, while the Warrant Officer strength went from 6 to 10. The detachment immediately dropped to 4 Officers to conform to the new TO&E, but with a continuing high quality of Warrant Officers obtained by the detachment, the change was not considered too drastic. Total authorized aviator strength remained at 14, but the detachment had only carried from 11 to 12 throughout the year. The authorized enlisted strength remained at 28, although some changes were made. The detachment gained 1 Senior Helicopter Mechanic, 1 Repair Parts Clerk, and 1 Equipment Records Clerk while losing 1 Aircraft Fuel Specialist, 1 Field Service Specialist, and 1 Radio Telephone Operator. With a large inflow of newly arrived personnel, the detachment was overstrength in enlisted personnel as 1968 drew to a close. All positions were filled throughout most of the year although some individuals were required to work outside of their MOS. This required some additional amount of on-the-job training and understandably caused some difficulties.The 57th Medical Detachment had six UH-1H aircraft which continued to be a tremendous asset toward accomplishing the detachment's mission. They proved to be durable and highly capable in numerous combat situations. One aircraft was lost during the year due to an accident resulting from a tail rotor failure and was immediately replaced with a new aircraft. Aircraft availability for the year was an overall 76%. Supply and maintenance support, though at times slow, was adequate for the most part.Air evacuation of casualties proved itself in the Republic of Vietnam as a highly effective means of evacuating patients. The majority of aeromedical evacuations were accomplished from field locations at or near the place of injury. Medical Regulations pertaining to the disposition of U.S. patients was well established by 1968. Patients could be evacuated to clearing stations, surgical stations, surgical hospitals, evacuation hospitals, or field hospitals as dictated by the patient's wound and the patient density at a specific hospital. Coordination with the Medical Groups at the time of evacuation effectively controlled the balance between in-country facilities.Vietnamese civilian and military personnel could be evacuated to U.S. facilities depending upon the proximity of the various Vietnamese hospitals. Vietnamese hospital quality had improved over 1968 and greater emphasis was placed on evacuating Vietnamese casualties to those hospitals as they became more self-supporting. Life and limb saving procedures could still be undertaken at U.S. facilities if the situation warranted but the majority of those patients were then furtl1er evacuated to Vietnamese hospitals.Security of landing zones was generally very good but presented problems at times. Enemy capabilities could be underestimated, and it had to be stressed to ground units that even in areas where it may not have seemed necessary, such as \"friendly\" villages, especially at night. It is also worth mentioning that a brief but honest description of the tactical situation given by the ground commanders when applicable prior to landing of the helicopter could often be advantageous.The Tet Offensive of January - February 1968 tested the capabilities of the detachment to a maximum. The entire detachment met the challenge with determination. Five out of six aircraft remained flyable with the pilots and crews flying steadily on eight-hour shifts around the clock. Most of the time the crews changed without shutting down the aircraft, and during the entire crisis, the unit was able to perform its mission flawlessly.On 15 February 1969 the detachment relocated from Long Binh Post to Lai Khe, replacing the 4th Flight Platoon, 45th Medical Company (Air Ambulance) due to increased mission requirements in that area. From Lai Khe, it continued throughout the year to support elements of the 1st Infantry Division, the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment and Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) Forces operating in the area.Aircraft maintenance and supply support received from the 605th Transportation Company (Direct Support) was outstanding. Maintenance down time was drastically reduced by technical assistance visits and close maintenance coordination between the detachment and Direct Support element. The drawdown, 1970–1972. On 15 February 1970 the detachment relocated from Lai Khe to Binh Thuy to augment the Dustoff mission in the Military Region IV. From Binh Thuy the detachment supported the ARVN 9th, 21st Divisions and the 44th Special Tactical Zone, and the U.S. and Vietnamese Navies, plus U.S. Advisory Teams.The Commanding Officer of the 57th Medical Detachment also commanded the 43d Medical Detachment (RB) which provided ground ambulance support on an assigned basis. The 82d Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) was also under the operational control of the 57th.A strenuous effort was being made to get the VNAF to perform medical evacuation in Military Region IV. At the end of 1970, there were 3 squadrons of VNAF helicopters in Military Region IV; 2 fully active at Binh Thuy Air Base and 1 at Soc Trang. Senior VNAF officers and USAF advisors revealed a lack of expertise in the area of aeromedical evacuation. Tentative plans were made to provide ground schooling for selectec1 VNAF pilots and then furnish the VNAF with qualified aircraft commanders from the 57th and 82d Medical Detachments to fly combat missions with mixed crews. Considerable interest had been shown by both VNAF and USAF advisors in creating a special unit to conduct medical evacuations.Some of the problem areas were: Lack of a definitive direction through VNAF channels that the squadrons would perform the mission and the number of aircraft that needed to be tasked for the mission; lack of specific training? in medical evacuation in the VNAF; and communications problems from Military Region IV to the VNAF. At the end of 1970, one officer of the 57th was assigned to draw up training plans for the VNAF and also work on the communication problems.Aircraft maintenance and supply support received from the 611th Transportation Company (Direct Support) was not satisfactory. Excessive down time and equipment deadlined for parts rates could be traced directly to Direct Support, and higher supporting units.Updating of existing facilities continued with installation of finished walls, partitions and air conditioning of the detachment orderly room, supply, and operations. All buildings were of permanent type, of either wood or metal construction. Asphalt paving had been accomplished, and steel planking, 80 by 110 feet, had been installed in the aircraft maintenance area through the self-help program.. The 82d Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) was under the operational control of the 57th Medical Detachment until 1 November 1971 when the 82d was redeployed to the United States. The 43d Medical Detachment (RB), a ground ambulance detachment which had also been under the operational control of the 57th, was reassigned to the 3d Surgical Hospital in May 1971 for closer coordination of their mission.From 3 March 1971 to 1 November 1971 the 57th Medical Detachment trained Vietnamese Air Force pilots to perform medical evacuation in Military Region IV. Plans were drawn up out of a meeting with senior VNAF officers, USAF officers, and D.R.A.C. advisors, resulting in a ground school for the Vietnamese pilots and medical aidmen as well as the 57th flying combat missions with the Vietnamese. As of the end of 1971, classes were being planned consisting of a four-week course covering essential medical training for the Vietnamese pilots. The classes had a target date of beginning on 15 January 1972. The course was patterned after the four-week course of instruction being taught at Fort Sam Houston, Texas under the title \"Essential Medical Training for AMEDD Aviatiors.\"On 10 February 1971 the detachment extended their area of coverage to include the ARVN 7th Division in addition to the 9th and 21st Divisions and the 44th Special Tactical Zones already covered as well as the U.S. and Vietnamese Navies and U.S. Advisory Teams.The 611th Transportation Company (Direct Support) greatly improved their performance in 1971 over that demonstrated in 1970. During 1971 the 611th had been of great assistance to the detachment in every respect. They gave support not only at their unit facilities, but also provided on-site maintenance and technical assistance whenever it was necessary. They greatly aided the 57th in the accomplishment of the detachment's mission.Aeromedical evacuation procedures. Night medical evacuation extractions became increasingly hazardous due to the Vietnamese field units not being equipped with necessary signaling devices, such as signaling flares, strobe lights, and so forth.The Vietnamese command structure was notified of the existing situation, but continued emphasis needed to be placed in this area.Essential signaling devices, and training in their use for night helicopter operations needed to be made available to units requesting medical evacuation. This problem could be alleviated by attaching specialists equipped to train and utilize this available equipment to various field units.U.S. and Vietnamese evacuation procedures. With the inception of the integrated flying and cross-training program on 3 March 1971, carried out by U.S. personnel, the program had progressed to the point where the Vietnamese Air Force pilots were accomplishing 85% of the ARVN missions in Military Region IV.The lack of both English-speaking Vietnamese and Vietnamese-speaking U.S. personnel provided a break of communications between the two forces in radio telephone operations section. The Vietnamese personnel sent missions incorrectly over the air, for example sending frequencies in the clear.The 57th recommended establishing a separate Vietnamese medical evacuation unit in Military Region IV. At the end of 1971, the necessary cross-trained Vietnamese personnel to establish such a unit were available. This would have served to alleviate communication difficulties and would allow for a separate operation to facilitate Vietnamese Dustoff operations.Classification of patients. As of the end of 1971, the Vietnamese radiotelephone operators were classifying the Vietnamese patients on a medical evacuation request as either urgent, priority, or routine. This classification was accomplished by word of mouth over the telephone without physically observing the wounded individuals.With the patient classification being made by detached personnel, many errors were made on the status or urgency of wounded personnel.All classifications should have been made by medical personnel or the senior ranking individual located with the wounded personnel. Command emphasis needed to be placed there to ensure a more exact classification procedure and, in most instances, speedier response for those who were truly urgent.U.S. Evacuation Procedures. Many valuable minutes were wasted by going to each U.S. Advisor location, picking up an interpreter (U.S. personnel plus Vietnamese interpreter) for each individual Vietnamese MEDEVAC request in the provinces. There were 16 provinces in Military Region IV with a minimum of four interpreter \"backseat\" pickups as many as twelve different locations depending on the province concerned. There was virtually no coordination due to a lack of parallel processing by the U.S. personnel of ARVN MEDEVACs.Missions ran too long due to the requirement to pick up an interpreter for each MEDEVAC where U.S. personnel are not on the ground. This could require picking up twelve different interpreters at twelve different locations for twelve different medical evacuations in a single province, to cite an extreme example.The 57th recommended that the ARVN establish a Vietnamese officer in charge of coordinating all Vietnamese Dustoff requests for each individual province. This solution would have provided one interpreter for pickup for each province for the MEDEVACs in that province. Coordinating the missions in each province would result.Establishing a formal Vietnamese dustoff unit. The 57th Medical Detachment had been working since 1 November 1070 toward the Vietnamization of Dustoff in Military Region IV. The following had been directed toward this end:From 1 November 1970 until 31 December 1970 ground school training was initiated for the Vietnamese pilots and their medics n the procedures of medical evacuation.On 1 March 1971 the flying program was initiated to test the ground school program initiated by the 57th. For eight months the U.S. aircraft commanders and medics flew over 4,000 hours with VNAF medics and VNAF pilots in order to standardize their approach to medical evacuation in the Mekong Delta. These figures do not reflect in the 57th's overall total for all flying time and patients picked up were logged with VNAF statistics.From an operational standpoint the 57th had to coordinate and tactfully suggest and push for VNAF higher command support for the Vietnamese Dustoff effort in Military Region IV.Established Medical Classes—extending to a four-week indoctrination for VNAF pilots who fly Dustoff in order to provide unity to the effort among the Vietnamese pilots and provide impetus to their dedication.The 57th Medical Detachment loaned equipment and supplies when the Vietnamese Squadron continuously provided minimal support to their Dustoff effort.Through the efforts of the 57th and 82d Medical Detachments, results were tremendously successful, as illustrated by the fact that the VNAF completed 85% of medical evacuations in the Delta in December 1971.However, a formal VNAF Dustoff unit could not be created in Military Region IV due to the VNAF system of establishing priorities—that combat assault helicopters must be dedicated before Dustoff aircraft are provided.A letter was forwarded from the Military Region IV Commanding General to the Commander in Chief of the Vietnamese Armed Forces recommending a formal, dedicated Dustoff unit be created. This met with a negative response.Though the 57th received some support from the Vietnamese Air Force in supplying aircraft for the Vietnamese Dustoff pilots, emphasis needed to be continued to be placed on a dedicated Vietnamese Dustoff unit.As an added example, if the Vietnamese Air Force could produce the impressive mission accomplishment figures that they did in the last quarter of 1971 without an operations officer, without consistent guidance and support from the Vietnamese Air Force command structure then common sense allows for accurate prediction of future mission accomplishment if a formal dedicated Vietnamese Dustoff unit were established.In 1972, the 57th Medical Detachment was organized under MTOE 8-500G, as a six-aircraft, 45-man detachment. Ideally the detachment consisted of four Medical Service Corps Officers, ten warrant officers, and 31 enlisted. For the first three months of 1972 the detachment was based in the Mekong Delta at the Binh Thuy Naval Air Station, where the detachment provided medical evacuation support for Military Region IV. However, due to the dwindling U.S. and FWMAF evacuation mission and the increasing role played by the Dustoff crews of the Vietnamese Air Force, the 57th Medical Detachment was redeployed to Long Binh to join a sister Dustoff unit, the 159th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) on 1 April 1972 to form Long Binh Dustoff. These detachments served both Military Regions II and IV, with the 57th Medical Detachment maintaining a one ship standby site at the Can Tho Army Airfield. The two detachments functioned as one unit, with the senior detachment commander serving as the commanding officer. On 15 October 1972 the 159th Medical Detachment was inactivated, its colors returning to Fort Benning, Georgia and the 57th Medical Detachment was again redeployed, this time to Tan Son Nhut Air Base in Saigon.From the beginning of 1972 until its redeployment to Long Binh Post, the 57th Medical Detachment was responsible for the training of Dustoff crews for the Vietnamese Air Force. Flying with American aircraft commanders, over thirty Vietnamese pilots were trained in this three-month period, becoming remarkably proficient in instrument flying, standardization, night flying, and tactical operations. During this same period the same number of Vietnamese medics and crew chiefs were also trained by the AMerican crew members on actual evacuation missions throughout Military Region IV. The achievement of the 57th Medical Detachment in this program, could not be overstated. As a result of this dedicated training the VNAF Dustoff crews were able to assume their responsibility for providing aeromedical evacuation assistance and support for the ARVN divisions in MR IV well ahead of a planned USARV Vietnamization schedule, thereby allowing the 57th Medical Detachment to redeploy to Long Binh Dustoff in time to offer additional strategic support to the allied forces embattled in the Easter Offensive in the Northwest part of Military Region III. As for the detachment's own training, the 57th Medical Detachment was fortunate enough to have two fine instrument instructor pilots, one a military instrument flight examiner, assigned to the two detachments of Long Binh Dustoff. All of the pilots of the two detachments benefitted tremendously from the ground school classes and training flights conducted by these instructor pilots, but after several months the program was discontinued due to the lack of aircraft that could be made available for training purposes.Throughout the year, the availability of aircraft parts and related logistics became increasingly harder to procure, and at best the supply of such items could be termed only fair. Vehicle parts were harder to obtain, which often resulted in a low vehicle availability for the detachment.The two major problems that plagued the 57th Medical Detachment were again a result of the continuing de-escalation of the American forces in Vietnam.First, due to the dwindling number of missions, the newer pilots and enlisted crew members earned little flight time, thereby preventing them from becoming fully knowledgeable of an extremely large area of operations, as well as from becoming skilled in tactical flying and operations.Secondly, the aircraft direct support maintenance was contracted to a civilian organization, MHA Field Services. As the 57th Medical Detachment had a low priority for direct support maintenance, aircraft which would normally be grounded for three or four days by military maintenance teams for periodic maintenance and inspections were delayed for as long as three weeks. Nonetheless, the detachment's own maintenance team was able to achieve an availability rate of approximately 85% despite this problem and the fact that aircraft logistical support was considered fair.A minor problem which continued to arise was the fact that POL stations (refueling points) for the aircraft across Military Regions III and IV were being closed down with the American withdrawal, and flight crews had to take special care to ensure their aircraft were properly refueled for each mission requirement. Inappropriate missions and the overclassification of patients remained continuing dilemmas. Redeployment, 1973. When it redeployed in March 1973, the 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) had qualified for all 17 campaign streamers that the Army had authorized for service in Vietnam.This section will explain the areas of stand-down, withdrawal and roll-up for the 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance). Stand-down, as used here, refers to the events and procedures for terminating operations. Withdrawal, as used here, refers to the actual redeployment of personnel. The roll-up phase will cover the transfer or turn-in of unit property. Stand-down phase. Planning. With a negotiated settlement to the conflict in the Republic of Vietnam drawing near, the need for a replacement activity for Dustoff was recognized by the U.S. Army Health Services Group, Vietnam (USAHSVCGPV). A contract agreement with Cords Aviation was reached in early January for them to replace the four DUSTOFF units in Vietnam. It was decided that the Cords Aviation corporation personnel would assume the detachment's mission in Military Region IV on X+30 and the mission in Military Region III on X+45. In connection with the Cords responsibilities and to assure a smooth transition, each of the DUSTOFF units would be required to contact their supported units and the Cords representative in their Military Region. The overall coordination responsibility was placed on the operations section of the 57th Medical Detachment.Taking into consideration the anticipated withdrawal and inactivation it was decided that a fifty percent posture on X+30 was appropriate. This fifty percent status would be reached gradually to insure complete and professional coverage of the detachment's mission. On X+45 the detachment's mission requirements would be terminated, and the remaining assets would be closed. The detachment's field standby would be terminated in two steps. The daily standby in support of the air cavalry units in the 57th's area of operation would be terminated on X-Day as the cavalry units completed their operation. The permanent Can Tho standby would terminate on X+30 as the Cords Aviation assumed the mission.A mission of great interest and importance was Operation Homecoming. This mission was the detachment's single most important concern, as the intense international interest in the POW releases mounted. Early intelligence indicated the possibility of returnees being released in small groups in remote locations with little prior notice. The detachment's leadership decided to place all personnel on twenty-four-hour alert as the treaty became effective. Each member of the detachment received complete briefings on their duty with concern to Operation Homecoming. As X-Day approached, further intelligence indicated the need to augment the aircraft of the detachment with ships and crews from the 247th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance), located in Nha Trang. Coordination with the U.S. Army Hospital, Saigon was initiated for means of reporting and delivery of returnees.Actual events. The contract with Cords Aviation was accepted in late January 1973. Air Operations Offices for Cords Aviation were contacted in each Military Region by the respective DUSTOFF Operations Officers. The purpose of this coordination was to affect a smooth transitioning period, to eliminate possible problem areas and to better understand limitations that would be inherent to such a transfer. With this agreement it was then possible for the DUSTOFF units to proceed with the termination of operations as scheduled.The termination of the detachment's field standby sites was carried out as planned. The Cavalry Troops in the 57th's area ceased operations on X-Day as planned and so the detachment's daily standby terminated with their requirement. The permanent standby in Can Tho terminated on X+30 as planned and an effective and smooth transition to Cords Aviation was made. As anticipated the withdrawal of troops justified the fifty percent posture on X+30 as planned, however a few problems were encountered (see withdrawal and roll-up phases, below). The fifty percent stand-down was accomplished a little behind schedule but proved appropriate as the detachment's mission decreased sharply as the deactivation period continued. On X+45 the entire operation was terminated, and Cords Aviation assumed the mission with no difficulties.The 57th Medical Detachment's role in Operation Homecoming was greatly diminished when the actual transfer was made. The two aircraft from Nha Trang arrived in Saigon on 27 January 1973 to augment the 57th Medical Detachment's assets. Two ships were deployed to Can Tho to cover Military Region IV. On X-Day the entire unit was placed on 100% alert bringing to bear six ships with complete crews for the detachment's area of operations. The detachment remained in this overreaction posture until X+10 when reliable intelligence was received to indicate the POWs would be released in large groups at a centralized point. The aircraft and crews from Nha Trang returned to base on X+12. During this same period of 100% readiness posture, a requirement was placed on the detachment for another ship and crew to remain on a three-minute alert at the heliport for Vice President Agnew's visit to Saigon. This additional commitment required another crew to remain on the flight line twenty-four hours a day for the duration of the Vice President's stay. The special crew for Mr. Agnew remained on the flight line, not leaving even for meals for four days. With the additional information available on Operation Homecoming and the special standby completed the unit return to normal alert rotation, that being one ship in Can Tho and two ships on alert in Saigon.When the first POW release was announced for 12 February 1973, the Detachment was briefed on its role. Since there was going to be a group released at a centralized point the headquarters element responsible for coordinating the operation decided only one Dustoff aircraft would be required. The remaining aircraft would be supplied by the 59th Corps Aviation Company. The detachment was also advised it would only be allowed a three-man crew, which was contrary to normal practices on any medical aircraft, but even over loud protests the three-man crew remained. The crew was chosen on 9 February 1973 and received extensive briefings from the operation commanders. At 0700 hours on 12 February 1973 the ship departed with the advance party for Loc Ninh for the release to take place.. After many hours of delay and bickering the contingent returned to Tan Son Nhut Air Base with the returnees at approximately 2100 hours. The Dustoff ship transported one litter patient, Captain David Earle Baker, USAF, the only POW that required immediate medical attention. The next POW release was scheduled for 27 February 1973 but due to difficulties with the major parties the release was delayed until 4 February 1973. The second release took place completely from Hanoi. With this release the detachment's role in the POW releases was completed. Withdrawal phase. Planning. When an agreement to end the hostilities in the Republic of Vietnam was imminent a roster of tentative X plus date DEROS was published by the Commanding Officer. The X plus DEROS roster was compiled with the coordination of each section leader to consider mission requirements anticipated and projected strength levels as directed by higher headquarters. Anticipated requirements indicated a fifty percent posture by X+30 would correlate with operational requirements. The drawdown to the fifty percent posture would be made gradually beginning on X+15. The first individuals to be released would be composed of hard DEROS personnel. After the first group the remaining personnel would be released in groups of five as their usefulness or requirement decreased. At X+30 the unit strength would be twenty-two personnel. These twenty-two remaining individuals would then be retained until X+45 to fulfill the mission requirements. At X+46 the personnel in the final group would begin to depart as the unit continued to inactivate. Key personnel, including the Commanding Officer, Operations Officer, Maintenance Officer and Property Book Officer would remain until approximately X+51 to complete the detachment's final closeout.Actual events. A great influx of personnel and the majority of the redeploying/inactivating units closing ahead of schedule caused initial planning changes to be made shortly after X-day. The detachment was required to amend its personnel rotation schedule to begin on X+29 with the fifty percent posture being reached at X+34. One aviator departed on X+10 as his normal Date of Estimated Return from Overseas (DEROS). On X+30 the departure of U.S. Forces was suspended because of the delay in the release of American POWs. Once again, the detachment's release projections were revised and when the POW problem was resolved on X+35 the detachment's personnel status was reduced to fifty percent. The remaining twenty-two personnel were retained until X+45 as previously planned. As the 57th's mission terminated on X+45 the detachment released personnel in groups of four and five until by X+49 only four personnel remained to complete the final closeout. On X+51 the last four personnel reported to Camp Alpha for their return to the United States. Roll-up phase. Planning. The turn-in and/or transfer of unit property was set forth in Operation Countdown (OPLAN 215). According to the guidance received much of the unit property was transferred to the ARVN or RVNAF prior to the peace treaty becoming a reality. The physical transfer of the property going to the Vietnamese Forces would not take place until the treaty became effective and at such a time when the requirement for the equipment by U.S. Forces was non-existent. All items not covered under Operation Countdown were to be turned into the keystone facility at Long Binh Post. The unit's aircraft physical transfer was under the direction of 1st Aviation Brigade G-4 section. The aircraft would be turned over to RVNAF with three being transferred by X+30. The remaining three ships would be physically transferred on or about X+45. All installation property had already been laterally transferred to the keystone processing activity prior to X-Day.Actual events. As directed in Operation Thunderbolt the appropriate equipment was transferred to ARVN and RVNAF forces prior to X-Day and hand receipted back to the detachment until the requirement for them no longer existed. Following directives from the 1st Aviation Brigade G-4 the 57th's aircraft were held in the detachment until the RVNAF came to sign for them. Originally the direct support unit was going to act as a holding agent, but it was decided this would add unnecessary work and delay, thus the detachment dealt directly with 1st Aviation Brigade and the RVNAF for aircraft transfer. The first actual transfer of an aircraft was 16 February 1973 (X+19) when aircraft 69-15620 was transferred to the RVNAF. The problem in POW release caused a delay in the physical transfer of aircraft 68-15465 and 69–15223. The difficulties were resolved on X+34 and both of these aircraft were physically transferred on X+40. The remaining aircraft, 69–15278, 69–15296, and 69-15181 were held until X+45 to correlate with mission requirements. Three days were allowed for preparation and the remaining aircraft were turned in on X+49.All weapons, ammunition, and signal grenades were turned in on 1 March 1973 (X+3l). The M-16 rifles were turned over to ARVN forces with the hand receipt. All other weapons to include pistols and grenade launchers were turned into keystone, while the ammunition was given to the Long Binh Depot. All station property was turned in as requirements permitted. The majority of the office equipment was turned into the keystone facility by X+30. With the first turn-in of the station property keystone revised the detachment's procedure. Instead of turning property in directly to keystone, who was acting as a holding agent, the detachment's property was hand receipted to all AFT; the receiving agency. The remaining station property was then physically transferred on X+46. All unit property was turned in by X+49 and the final audit was completed on X+50. Support to XVIII Airborne Corps. Congress established the Military Aid to Safety and Traffic (MAST) program with an effective date of 1 July 1974. This program was designed to allow Army air ambulance units to provide aeromedical evacuation support to civilian communities where they did not compete with an established civilian air ambulance service. The idea behind the program was that it would increase aviator and crew proficiency in Dustoff units while at the same time provide a much-needed service to local civilian communities. The 57th began MAST operations shortly after the program was established.The mission of the 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) at Fort Bragg was to: Provide aeromedical evacuation of selected patientsProvide emergency movement of medical personnel and accompanying equipment and supplies to meet a critical requirement. Ensure uninterrupted delivery of blood, biologicals, and medical supplies when there was a critical requirement. Provide Military Assistance to Safety and Traffic (MAST) effective 1 July 1974The above mission could be summed up as providing evacuation of patients at Fort Bragg, North Carolina to and from Womack Army Hospital and also to and from civilian hospitals within a 100-kilometer radius of Fort BraggThe 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) underwent significant changes to its MTOE due to the consolidated change to MTOE 08660HFC04 FC0176 with an effective date of 21 October 1975. The loss of one vehicle and trailer was felt to hamper the detachment's ability to accomplish a rapid and efficient air-loaded movement.Of the total flight hours, 249.9 hours were performed for MAST missions in which 109 patients were evacuated.On 12 October 1980, the 57th Medical Detachment completed its one-thousandth MAST mission.On 12 April 1982 the 57th Medical Detachment was reorganized from an RA Team to an RG Team. The primary change in the reorganization was that its UH-1 Aircraft were replaced by UH-60 Blackhawks, with the first Blackhawk being received by the detachment on 15 June 1982. As it had been in the late 1950s, the 57th Medical Detachment was the first non-divisional medical evacuation unit to receive advanced aircraft—Eagle Dustoff of the 326th Medical Battalion having received the Army's first operational UH-60 Air ambulance on 15 January 1982.On 12 February 1983, the 57th Medical Detachment was named runner-up in the U.S. Army Forces Command Commanding General's Award for maintenance excellence.In June 1983, the detachment deployed to Egypt to participate in Exercise Bright Star.On 27 February 1985, the 57th Medical Detachment was again named runner-up in the U.S. Army Forces Command Commanding General's award for Maintenance Excellence.Between 1 July 1974 and 1 March 1985, the 57th Medical Detachment completed more than 1,500 MAST missions in support of civilian communities in Virginia and the Carolinas.In January and October 1988, the 57th Medical Detachment provided aircraft and crews in support of Joint Task Force Bravo in Honduras.. On 23 December 1989, the 57th Medical Detachment deployed three aircrews to Panama in support of Operation JUST CAUSE. The crews deployed in support of the 214th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance), which was permanently stationed in Panama, and were integrated into that organization's operations. The detachment itself was not granted campaign participation credit for participation in Operation JUST CAUSE.In February 1990, the 57th Medical Detachment supported the deployment of aircraft and crews to Honduras in support of Joint Task Force Bravo.In August 1991, the 57th deployed to support Operation Green Stalk in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Operation Green Stalk was a counter-narcotics operation.. In June 1992 the detachment began receiving additional equipment from the 36th Medical Detachment at Fort Polk, Louisiana in preparation for the 57th's upcoming reorganization.Two aircrews were deployed to Homestead Air Force Base, Florida in August 1992 as part of Hurricane Andrew relief efforts.On 16 September 1992, the 57th Medical Detachment was reorganized and redesignated as the 57th Medical Company (Air Ambulance). Although the previous air ambulance companies, dating back to the 1st Air Ambulance Company (Provisional) in the Koran War, had been composed of 25 ships, the new design was of a 15-ship company, with three 3-ship Forward Support MEDEVAC Teams and a six-ship area support team. Each team had the necessary maintenance and refueling capability to operate separately from the company for periods of time, a capability lacking in both the 25-ship company and the 6-ship detachment. And, once again, the 57th led the way, being the first air ambulance company to reorganize under the new structure.In January 1993, the detachment supported a deployment of aircraft and crews to Honduras in support of Joint Task Force Bravo.The 57th Medical Company (Air Ambulance) began the 1998 with numerous external missions that required the company to provide additional MEDEVAC coverage to many geographically separated and remote areas.  The unit accomplished this mission by providing two UH-60A helicopters to Fort Stewart, Georgia in support of 3rd Infantry Division, one aircraft in support of the 5th Ranger Training Battalion, Dahlonega, Georgia and the continuous 24-hour MEDEVAC mission at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.  In addition, the unit maintained two UH-60As with aircrews in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia providing support to the 4404th Air Wing (Provisional) at Prince Sultan Air Base (PSAB) as part of Operation Southern Watch.In early January 1998, the unit was tasked to provide six aircraft and crews in support of Operation Purple Dragon, at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.  The unit performed the mission flawlessly.  The month of March found the company conducting a C-5 loadout with a Forward Support MEDEVAC Team and then further deploying to the field for a Company FTX.  The loadout was conducted as part of the unit's effort to remain trained in strategic air deployment activities.The company redeployed an FSMT (-) from Saudi Arabia in early July utilizing an Air Force C-17.  The utilization of the C-17 was an excellent opportunity for the unit to build load plans for the new aircraft.  The aircrews had barely returned from the long 14-month deployment when the FORSCOM ARMS arrived at Fort Bragg.  The 57th Medical Company (Air Ambulance) performed magnificently as it received 2 of 3 FORSCOM Commander's coins given for outstanding performance.  The unit received several commendable ratings and regained respect among the aviation units on Simmons Army Airfield.On 6 August 1998, the company conducted a change of command ceremony in which MAJ Harold Abner relinquished command to MAJ Scott Putzier.  The unit immediately moved into the planning stages for its first External Evaluation (EXEVAL) in over 5 years.  The unit conducted an EXEVAL train-up FTX in AUG as part of its support to the 82d Airborne Division, Division Support Command (DISCOM) Operation Provider Strike Exercise.  During the operations the company supported on one level or another all three Forward Support Battalions and the Main Support Battalion.  In September the unit conducted a defensive live fire on OP-9, a successful live fire concentrating on a perimeter defense.  Also in September the unit conducted a C-5 static load at Pope Air Force Base.  On 19 October, the order was issued, and the company began to prepare for its mission.  The EXEVAL included a C-5 loadout as part of the scenario prior to the conduct of the EXEVAL.  The EXEVAL, from 19 to 23 October, provided an excellent opportunity for the new commander to determine the company's weak areas and develop a training plan for the next year.  The unit performed well in most areas and was granted credit for the EXEVAL by the 55th Medical Group Commander.. In November 1998, the 498th Medical Company (Air Ambulance), a sister company at Fort Benning, Georgia, deployed to provide humanitarian relief to several countries in Central America.  The 57th Medical Company (Air Ambulance) was tasked to provide support to 5th Ranger Training Battalion-Dahlonga, GA, 6th Ranger Training Battalion-Eglin Air Force Base, FL, 3rd Infantry Division (M) at Fort Stewart, GA in addition to the 24 hour MEDEVAC support to XVIII Airborne Corps and Fort Bragg.  Added to the unit's tremendous workload in November was C,FSMT's deployment to JRTC in support of 3rd Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division and the unit's Initial Command Inspection for the new commander.The 57th Medical Company (Air Ambulance) began 1999 with numerous external missions requiring the unit to provide aeromedical support to Fort Bragg, Fort Stewart, and the Ranger Training Battalions located at Dahlonega Georgia and Eglin Air Force Base Florida.The 57th Medical Company supported both Ranger Training Battalions for the first two months of the year while the 498th Medical Company (Air Ambulance) recovered its personnel and equipment from their South America deployment.On 18 May 1999 the 57th Medical Company conducted Deck Landing Qualifications (DLQs) with the USNS Comfort off the North Carolina Coast, qualifying five aircrews, receiving tours of the ship, and providing the USNS Comfort's deck crew and fire fighters emergency engine shutdown and crews extraction training.  This was the first time in over two years the unit had conducted DLQs on the USNS Comfort.August and September 1999 proved to be very busy deploying the FSMT (-) to Kuwait, fielding the ASIP Radio systems, and supporting an 82d Airborne Division Joint Readiness Training Center rotation.  The unit provided EFMB Evaluation and testing support to the 44th Medical Brigade EFMB in September running the Litter Obstacle Course and providing the aircraft and evaluators to the Evacuation Lane.  The EFMB Testing cycle was disrupted by Hurricane Floyd, which caused the evacuation of the unit's aircraft at Fort Bragg and Fort Stewart.Hurricane relief efforts in 1999 involved the entire company as the unit flew 58 hours utilizing all available aircrews to include those Battalion staff members on flight status.  During the weeklong relief operation, the company provided continuous aircraft support to the disaster/flood area in support of Federal Emergency Management Agency operations which resulted in over 80 patients/individuals rescued or moved shelters.Within days of the hurricane relief operations ending, the unit again sent an FSMT in support of the 82d Airborne Division to the Joint Readiness Training Center that consumed most of the month of October. Operation Urgent Fury. The 57th Medical Detachment deployed to the Island of Grenada to participate in Operation URGENT FURY on 29 October 1983.

A king and a queen have a beautiful daughter. One day, an old witch tells the queen she and her husband can regain their youth if they kill their daughter and eat her liver and heart. The princess talks to her pet horse, Lurja, and confides in it about the murderous plan. The horse advises her to trick her parents: she is to ask the king and the queen to be dressed as a man and for her to take a ride on the horse to see the world before she dies.. It happens as the horse predicts and the princess seizes the opportunity to escape to another kingdom, in a male disguise. In this new kingdom, the king's son invites her to a hunt. The king's son suspects she is a girl, but his mother insists otherwise and tells him to test her: first by racing; then by going to the war treasury and choose what most appeals to a masculine mind.. The princess is eventually unmasked, but marries the king's son as she is. Her husband is invited as guest to another king, and borrows his wife's horse, Lurja. While he is away, she gives birth to a golden-haired son and writes a letter to him. A royal messenger takes the letter to deliver to the prince, but he spends the night in a house, where the contents of the letter are altered to say she gave birth to an abomination. The prince receives the letter and writes back that she and her son are to be kept safe until his return. The messenger passes by the same house, and the prince's letter is falsified with a command to burnt the princess and her son in an oven.. The horse Lurja senses that something is wrong with the princess and, despite one leg being tied to a pole, breaks free and races to the save the princess. He reaches the princess in the nick of time, on three legs, takes the princess and her son, and flies far away. At a safe distance, the horse realizes that being a three-legged beast is of no use to the princess, and urges her to kill it, place its three legs on three corners and its head in the middle. Reluctantly, she follows the horse's instructions and chants a spell; a temple is built in their place. The princess raises her son in this new place.. Meanwhile, the prince returns home and learns of the exchanged letters, and falls into despair, thinking that his wife and son were burnt in the oven. His father, the king, seeing his son's grief, decides to wander the world in search of his daughter-in-law and grandson. He eventually reaches the temple and meets his grandson and his mother. Analysis. Tale type. Georgian scholar T. Kurdovanitze identified a new tale type, not listed in the international Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index: a magical horse helps mother and son escape from burning and rides into the unknown with them; later, parts of its body (entrails, horsehide, etc.) transform into a castle to shelter mother and son, and her husband finds them.This tale is classified by Georgian scholarship as an independent tale type in the Georgian Folktale Index, numbered -538*, \"The Beauty and her Horse\", with 12 variants listed. Other regions. In a 2013 article, researcher Veronica Muskheli, from University of Washington, took notice of a cycle of stories that she located in Central Asia. In this narrative, which she named Woman's Magical Horse, the heroine rides her magical horse to escape from a great evil, usually wears masculine clothes, and eventually finds a husband. The horse eventually perishes after helping the heroine one last time and she uses the horse's remains to build a new home for her.According to Basque researcher Koldo Biguri, Italian folklorist Sebastiano Lo Nigro located stories of the crossdressing heroine, her helpful horse and the flight from an unwanted monstruous suitor in Italy, Catalonia and Basque Country - which corresponds to Type C in Lo Nigro's study.In a study about the European cycle of La Doncella Guerrera (\"The Warrior Maiden\"), French historian François Delpech identified a second form of the cycle, which he termed La fille qui a épousé le diable (English: \"The girl who married the devil\"). In this form, the crossdressing heroine is still put to the test of her gender, but she is helped by her faithful magic horse. Delpech also concluded that the heroine's horse is the one that rescues her from a terrible marriage with a supernatural being and sets her up with a beneficial human partner. Motifs. According to scholarship, the Georgian word lurǯa means a 'blue-gray' color, or refers to a horse of dark gray colour.According to Chilean folklorist Yolando Pino Saavedra, in some variants, the heroine is betrothed or already married to a gentleman (who is a devil in disguise), and escapes from him in a \"Magical Flight\" sequence. Despite the presence of the motif, these tales are not classified as type ATU 313, \"The Magic Flight\". Relation to other tale types. In an article in Enzyklopädie des Märchens, narrative researcher Ines Köhler-Zülch stated that this narrative (heroine and magic horse save themselves from demonic bridegroom) may also start as tale type AaTh 621, \"The Flea\": her father, the king, fattens a louse and uses its hide as a suitor's riddle; a demonic bridegroom guesses it right.Italian scholar Sebastian Lo Nigro, in his study, noted that the motif of the sequence of falsified letters harks back to tale type ATU 706, \"The Maiden Without Hands\". Variants. Europe. Georgia. In a Georgian tale titled Arcivis švili and translated into Russian as \"Сын орла\" (\"Eagle Son\") or into German as Der Sohn des Adlers, a king has no children, until one day his wife gives birth to an eagle. The king orders for a hole to be excavated and the eagle to be thrown down there. The eagle is fed with oxen, and devours the royal cattle in no time. The king announces that the populace is to feed the bird with their cattle or, lacking it, with humans. One day, an orphan girl is selected as the next sacrifice and goes to her mother's grave to weep over her fate. The mother's spirit appears to the girl and advises her: she is to dress in a buffalo hide and ask the eagle prince to take off its skin. The girl obeys the instructions and is roped down the hole in a buffalo skin. The eagle watches her intently and orders her to take off her skin, but the girl retorts that the eagle should take off his first. The eagle obeys and sheds the birdskin to become a youth of so great a beauty he illuminates the hole. Some servants of the king fail to hear any screams, and go to check: the girl is still alive, and a youth is there as well, with no trace of the eagle. The servants tell the king, who does not believe them and has them executed. Then, the goes to check for himself and confirms the servants' story. He marries his son, now human, to the girl, and gives her a magical horse. One day, the prince has to journey to another city, and borrows his wife's magical horse. While he is away, his wife gives birth to a golden-haired boy, and writes a letter the tell her husband the good news. A royal messenger is given the letter to deliver to the prince, but spends the night in a house. A woman that lives in the house writes that the princess gave birth to a puppy. The messenger delivers the false letter, and the prince writes that she is to be protected until his return. The same messenger spends the night again at the same house, and the same woman takes the true letter and falsifies it with a command to take the princess and her son and burn them in an oven. The princess and her son are put in a chest and taken to the oven. However, her magical horse rushes to her, takes the chest out of the oven and rides with it to another land. The horse arrives at a desert and bursts open the chest, releasing mother and son. With no more strength, the horse tells the princess she can use its tail as a whip, so that, with every crack of the whip on the ground, the desert can be filled with flowers. The horse dies, and the princess follows the horse's instructions. Mother and son live out their days in this new land, and the boy grows up as a fine hunter. The tale then veers into tale type ATU 315, \"The Faithless Mother\". Romania. Arthur Carl Victor Schott and Albert Schott collected a similar Romanian tale from Banat with the title Die Kaiserstochter und das Füllen (\"The Kaiser's Daughter and the Foal\"). A foal is born at the same day as a human princess. Both foal and princess become friends and companions. She feeds the horse with fire and wine. When she is 15 years old, her father, the emperor, decides it is time for her to marry, and sets a riddle for any suitors: he covers a drum with the skin of two fleas, and whoever guesses it right shall have the princess as wife. Many try, to no avail, until a powerful and wicked dragon, adept at magic arts, guesses it is made of louseskin (tale type ATU 857, \"The Louseskin\"). The princess confides in her pet horse about the horrible husband-to-be, but the horse advises her to ask her father to make three maale garments. The princess dress in male clothes and rides the horse to regions unknown, when she sees that the dragon is after her. The horse asks her what speed it should ride to elude the dragon: the speed of thought or the speed of wind, and the princess answers everytime the dragon is near. After they elude their pursuer, the princess arrives at a new realm, and the horse gives her a magic cushion to press whenever she feels she needs its help. In this new city, the princess offers her services to the emperor who rules the city, an old friend of her father, and gains his trust over time. And so rumours begin to spread among the emperor's advisers, who convince the emperor his new friend is an impostor, and a woman in man's garb. The emperor decides to test this theory - and the newcomer - by having his son accompany the youth to the marketplace (if he is a man, he will want to look at weaponry) and to the royal vineyard (if he is a man, he will eat the grapes raw). With her horse's advice, she avoids falling in their trap. However, as a third test, she is to get a bride for emperor: a princess locked in a glass castle on a glass hill, captive of a powerful wizard. The princess brings the maiden to the emperor and reveals them the whole truth. The emperor decides to marry his son to the princess, in the name of the friendship between him and the girl's father. Some time later, war breaks out, and the emperor sends his son to fight. While he is away at war, his wife, the princess, gives birth to two golden boys. The royal messenger rushes to the battlefield to give a letter with the good news, and spends the night in an inn. A sequence of false letters leads the princess and her twin boys to be burned at the stake. The executioners lead the mother and children to the stake, and she presses the cushion she had with her. The magical horse rushes to her and inhales the fire to put it out. The princess sits on the horse with her children, and departs to regions unknown. At a safe distance, the horse tells her its time is at an end, and advises her that, after he dies, for her to cut his belly and spread its entrails to the four corners, its heart in the middle, and for her to sleep in its skin. The princess follows the horse's instructions and, the next day, a palace appears, with two lions as guards in front of the castle. Meanwhile, her husband goes back home, but does not find neither his wife, nor his children. Falling into a deep grief for the following years, the prince travels a bit, and sends a servant to find lodge for them. The messenger returns and points to a grand palace nearby, with two lions guarding it. The prince and his retinue go to the palace and find the mistress of the castle: his wife. Moldova. Author Grigore Botezatu published a Moldavian tale titled Carminea (in the original, \"Кырмыза\" or Kyrmyza). In this tale, the titular Carminea is the beautiful daughter of a landlord. When she is 17 years old, her father places her daughter on a tower, and erects a staircase made of glass and precious stones, and sets a test for her suitors: they are to ride on horseback, jump high and get her ring from her hand. Many try, but a dragon riding a lion fulfills the test. Her father invites everyone to the betrothal party, but Carminea retires to the stables to confide in her pet horse Gaitan. The horse advises her to get rid of her unwanted suitor. The next day, the dragon suitor rides the lion, while Carminea lags behind. Following the horse's instructions, she decapitates the dragon in a surprise attack. She rides to a distant village and dresses up as a male rider to maintain the charade. A man named John befriends her and suspects she is a girl, so his grandmother advises him to put her through some tests: racing, finding use for the sticks in a cart, choosing between swords and yarns; and stepping on a besom placed in the doorway. Carminea passes through the first three tests, but is unmasked in the fourth one. She reveals her identity to John and they marry. However, John is drafted to war and joins the fray. After some time, Carminea is pregnant, and John writes home. He gives a letter to a friend to deliver it, and John's friends spends a night in a house - the house of the mother of the dead dragon suitor. She writes false command on the letter to burn Carminea at the stake. Gaitan tells her what to do: walk to her execution, then ride Gaitan into the fire, get a kerchief from its right ear and toss it in the fire. Carminea and Gaitan ride away to a valley near a spring. Carminea senses she is in labour, and Gaitan announces his time is over. Carminea sleeps, and the next morning awakes inside a great castle. The story then explains that parts the horse became parts of the castle: the body became the castle, the head became a table with dishes, its ears and eyes became two wolf hounds that guard the castle, the mane became a beautiful orchard, and one of its hooves turned into an old maidservant that helps Carminea in rearing her two golden-haired sons. Kalmyk people. In a tale from the Kalmyk people with the title \"О девушке, ставшей царицей, и о ее одиннадцати сыновьях\" (\"About the Girl who became a queen and her 11 sons\"), girl Badma wears feminine clothes at home, but disguises herself as a youth when grazing with the herd. One day, a creature named mus breaks into her house and devours her parents, but she escapes with the help of a horse. Now orphan, she employs herself to a local khan still disguised as male, but the khan tries to reveal her female identity. After some attempts, her magical horse convinces her to tell her story to the khan, who falls in love with Badma. The khan expels his previous 500 Shulma wives and marries the girl. The next year, war erupts, and the khan departs with his wife's magical horse to fight, while she stays and gives birth to eleven sons with golden breast and silver backside. The previous Shulma wives intercept a letter and falsify it to tell the khan his wife gave birth to 11 puppies. The khan orders Badma and her elder son to be cast into the sea in a barrel. Their barrel washes ashore on an island. Badma's magical horse finds its rider and, to help her, the horse begs to be sacrificed and its remains to be distributed nearby. Saddened, they follow through with the instructions, and wake up in a white, carpeted kibitka. Later, the elder son shapeshifts into a sparrow to spy on his father's court, where the previous 500 Shulma wives comment on strange wonders: a beautiful woman that comes out of the water, and on a certain beach 10 youths with golden breast and silver backside come out of the sea to eat food on their golden plates. Poland. Philologist and folklorist Julian Krzyżanowski, establisher of the Polish Folktale Catalogue according to the international index, located a similar narrative in Poland, which he dubbed type T 706A, \"Królewna i źrebię\" (\"Princess and the Foal\"). In the Polish tale, collected by folklorist Oskar Kolberg in Baranowa (Lubelskie) with the title Cudowne źrebię (\"The Magical Foal\"), a king has a beautiful daughter. He sets a test for any suitors (though many have failed and died): if anyone guesses the princess's name, they shall have the princess as bride. One day, the princess mutters to herself her own name (Marcybelo), which is heard by an evil spirit. The evil spirit disguises himself as a rich suitor and wins the princess as his bride. Before the princess leaves, she has a dream about a herd of horses just outside of the castle. Her dream is real, and one of the little foals of the herd follows the princess to her room. The foal warns the princess that her suitor is an evil spirit, and concocts a plan with her: when she is in the carriage on the way to the church, she shall sit on the right side and jump onto the foal. It happens so and she rides the horse to another castle, and jumps over a wall to a prince's garden. The gardener sees her and informs the prince, who takes her as his wife. The princess is taken to a summer palace to be more at ease, and gives birth to male twins. Her mother-in-law writes her son a letter about the good news, but the letters are intercepted and falsified by the evil spirit. The prince's mother reads the forged letter and carries out the false orders: the princess and her two children are to be burnt in a pyre. As she is led to her execution, the foal (which was locked in the stables) hurries to its master and whisks her away to safety. At a safe distance, on a vast meadow, the foal begs the princess to kill it, use its head to build a well and its ribs a city. The princess names the city \"Marcybelin\". Not long after, the prince, her husband, learns of the situation and goes to look for her with iron shoes and an iron cane. Portugal. Portuguese scholars Isabel Cárdigos and Paulo Jorge Correia locate a similar tale type in the Portuguese Folktale Catalogue, numbered 533A, Portuguese: Cavalo mágico salva noiva do Diabo, lit. 'Magic horse saves Bride from the Devil': the heroine marries a strange suitor, who turns out to be of evil nature; a horse takes her away in a magic flight to another kingdom, where she spends some time in male disguise; she reveals her identity and marries the prince; the prince goes to war; the heroine gives birth to her child and writes her husband a letter; the letters are falsified by the former suitor; the heroine escapes with her horse and the animal creates a new house for her and her child.Portuguese author Trindade Coelho published the tale O Conto da Infeliz Desgraçada (English: Tale from Alentejo of an Unfortunate Wretch) in his book Os Meus Amores. In this tale, an old king asks his fifteen year old daughter to find a husband. The princess hears a voice telling her to marry only a man with ivory teeth, and the king summons every man, until the ivory-toothed man comes to marry her. When she prepares to leave her castle to go with her husband, the princess (named Isabel) hears another voice coming from the stables. She goes to check it and finds a \"cardano\" horse with black mane that tells her to take the horse with her, lest something evil befalls her. It is agreed on, and Isabel rides the horse. After some 200 days journey, her husband disappears from view, and the horse advises her to ride to a small cottage. Isabel does and finds two straws and a piece of paper inside it that she takes with herself. The husband appears behind her, and the horse tells her to drop the objects behind her: the paper to create a mist, the first straw, filled with needles, to create a forest, and the second straw, filled with water, to create a river between them. After safely escaping from the ivory-toothed man, the horse advises Isabel to dress in male clothing, and to go to another court, where she will pass her off as a youth named José. The second king tries to buy \"José\"'s horse, but he refuses. Later, after suspecting the newcomer is truly a woman, he plots with an old lady how to unmask her: to have her choose sits at the dining table, and to join him in his bedchambers. José passes the first test, but reveals her true identity in the king' room and marries him. Some years later, the king has to go to war and borrows Isabel's horse, while she stays at the palace and gives birth to two sons. A king's messenger takes a letter and runs to the battlefield to deliver it, but spends the night at an inn, where the innkeeper writes a false letter. The king receives the false letter and writes another, that is also forged by the innkeeper, with a command to banish her from the palace. Isabel receives the sad news and, despite bemoaning her fate, leaves the palace with her sons and wanders around the world. Suddenly, her cardano horse appears to her, having fled from the battlefield, and alerts her that her first bridegroom is after her, but the horse will do battle against him; after the horse perishes, Isabel is to get whatever she finds inside his mouth. It happens so: the princess takes the horse's tongue, throws it on the ground and a tower appears to house her and her children. Back to the king, he returns from war, learns about the forged letters, and decides to look for his wife. He stops by the same inn, and meets an old man that is also looking for her. Both decide to look for Isabel together and find her tower. They are welcomed inside, and, after dining with Isabel and her sons, she introduces her children to her father and her husband. Basque Country. Author Wentworth Webster collected a Basque language tale named Zorria (\"The Flea\") from Saint-Jean-de-Luz, which was published by French linguist Julien Vinson with the title Le Pou (\"The Flea\"). In this tale, a king has three daughters. One day, his youngest daughter finds a flea in his hair. The king fattens the bug, kills it and uses its hide as part of a riddle for the princess's suitors. A gentleman wearing gold garments (the devil in disguise) guesses it right and is given the hand of the youngest princess, named Fifine, in marriage. Fifine goes to the stables and a white mare warns her that her suitor is the devil, and that, as parting gift, the princess must choose to take the mare with her. It happens so. On the road, the white mare trots the ground, and it commands the earth to swallow the devil for seven years. The mare's enchantment works, and Fifine is saved, but the animal advises her to dress in masculine clothes and go to another kingdom. In this new kingdom, Fifine and the white mare find shelter in a prince's castle. The prince tells his mother he had a dream their guest is a woman, and the queen advises him to test her: to make her choose guns and weapons at the market, to have her horse trample on a piece of linen, and to take a bath in the river. With the mare's help, Fifine passes the tests, but eventually reveals herself to the prince and marries him. The white mare gives Fifine a chirola, for her to use in extreme distress, and departs. Fifine and the prince live in relative peace and harmony for seven years, and she gives birth to a boy and a girl. One day, her husband has to go to war and leaves her with his mother. While he is away, the devil rises from the ground and meets Fifine and her children, and takes them to the forest. Fifine begs for him to grant her a last request, and she blows on the chirola. The white mare appears to her, stomps on the ground and the devil disappears for good. Fifine decides not to return to her mother-in-law's castle, so the mare gives her a magic cane for her to create a manor if she strikes the ground with it. Fifine's husband returns from war and, not seeing his family, looks for them in the forest. He finds the manor with Fifine and their children inside. Its mission accomplished, the white mare turns into a white dove and flies to Heaven. Webster presumed a French origin for the tale, due to the heroine's name (Fifine), and claimed that the tale was from \"Laurentine, Sister of Toutou\". The tale was also translated into English as Fifine and the White Mare and its second part, Fifine and the Prince, and both sourced from Gascony, France. Spain. In her catalogue of Spanish sources, scholar Montserrat Amores reports few variants of Spanish type 533A, \"El Caballo Mágico salva a la novia del Diablo\" (English: \"Magic Horse saves girl from the Devil\"), in Spain.Galician ethnographer Lois Carré Alvarellos published a tale collected from San Xián de Sergude, titled Iria e o Cabalo Boligán (\"Iria and the Horse Boligan\"). In this tale, a princess named Iria does not want to marry anyone. One day, a horse in the stables, named Boligan, calls for her and advises her to tell her father she wants to marry a man with perfect ivory teeth, hoping that such a man does not exist. However, a man with this exact trait, a rich and powerful Moor, appears in the kingdom and asks to marry her. The princess cries over her fate, but the horse counsels her to take the horse with her. Some days into their journey, something startles the Moor's mount and he falls to the ground, allowing Iria to flee on her mount. She rides to a distant hut and rests with an old woman, who, the next day, gives the princess a tuft of sheep wool and a stack of needles. Iria journeys on, when her fiancé, the Moor, rides just behind them. Boligan, the horse, tells the princess to throw behind her the old woman's objects to delay the pursuit: the wool creates a mist and the needles great boulders. The third time, she throws behind her a piece of silk, creating a lake to deter the Moor. At a safe distance, the horse advises her to buy male clothes, take on a male name, Payo, and to find work as a king's page. The second king suspects Payo is a girl underneath the disguise and tries to unmask her by setting tests: to catch an apple between her legs; and to stay by the king's bed at night. Her horse, Boligan, however, warns her against every attempt. Eventually, Iria reveals herself and marries the king. Time passes, and a Moor army is at the king's door; Iria's husband, the king, borrows Boligan and marches to battle, leaving her at the castle. Iria notices that her former fiancé, the Moor, is leading the army, and gives birth to twin boys \"like two suns\". Her mother-in-law writes her son a letter with the good news, but a series of forged missives force the king's mother to carry out false orders to kill her. Crying, Iria takes her sons and leaves the kingdom, hoping to reach her father's homeland. One morning, she wakes up and sees her loyal horse Boligan in front of her. The horse tells her the Moorish king will come after her, but Boligan will fight him to the death; in case he dies, Iria is to take whatever she finds in his mouth. Just as the horse predicted, the Moor comes to kill her, but Boligan kills him in a fierce battle, and perishes, his form reverting to a human shape. Iria mourns for her fallen friend, gets his tongue and tosses it on the floor; a stone tower appears to house her and her children, furnished with everything they need. Back to Iria's husband, he returns home and, learning of the changed letters, begins a journey in search of her. He meets a long-bearded old man, and both ride to the stone tower. Inside, Iria welcomes them and, after dinner, embraces the king as her husband and the old man as her father.Researcher Marisa Rey-Henningsen collected a tale from a Galician source which she translated as The Countess's Daughter and The Talking Horse. In this tale, Floriña is the daughter of a rich woman who is a countess. Many men have courted her, but her mother does not want to surrender her to any man. Even a powerful Moorish king makes a bid for the girl's hand, and threatens to kill both mother and daughter if they do not agree to it. Floriña weeps, and walks a bit with her mother's horse, which begins to talk. It advises Floriña that she shall only marry a man with perfectly white teeth, white as the freshly fallen snow. The Moorish king says he is that man, and gets to marry Floriña. The horse laments that their initial plan failed, so it suggests the girl takes her mother's horse with her to her new home. On the journey to the Moorish king's house; the horse seizes the opportunity to bump into the moor and his horse, and gallops away with Floriña to a Christian king's land. In the Christian king's castle, Floriña trades her womanly clothes for a peasant's and a cap. She works as a page in the second king's castle, and the king suspects she is a woman, and not a man. The Christian king's mother advises him to test the page: ask him to show his hands (either their palms, if a man), throw him a bunch of kindlewood (he will catch it between his legs if a man), and finally to ask him to sleep with him in his bed. Floriña passes by the first two tests, and begins to undress herself to join the king in his bed, when they hear a commotion in the streets: the Moorish king comes back with an army in search of his wife. The Christian king tries to deter him, but the Moor kills him, and goes after Floriña. She escapes from the attack and calls out for her mother's horse, and the animal rides to her aid. They gallop together across a field of dead bodies, both Christians and Moors, and the animal advises her to take its tongue in the hour of dire need. The horse stops by the side of a bridge, the Moor king on the other side. The Moor changes into a sparrow hawk to fly over the water and reach Floriña, and the horse warns the girl to cut off its tongue. In a rapid movement, the girl grabs a knife, cuts off the horse's tongue and throws it on the ground: a solid tower springs up to protect her, while the horse fights the Moor. The Moor stabs the horse in the neck with his sword, and it falls to the ground. The horse changes into a human prince, and, in the confusion, takes the sword to kill the Moor. From inside the tower, Floriña sees the battle and climbs down the tower to help the man. She brings him inside the tower, dresses his wounds and restores him to full health. Despite him not talking at all, Floriña begins to fall in love with him, and, one day, kisses him: the tower disappears and the man regains his speech, telling the girl a wicked fairy cursed him to an equine shape. Floriña and the man journey back to her mother's land, where she learns her mother died of grief, but later she marries the man. Italy. Folklorist Domenico Comparetti collected a tale titled Il drago (\"The Dragon\") from Pisa, which was later published by author Italo Calvino with the title The Dragon and the Enchanted Filly (Italian: Il Drago e la cavallina fatata). In this tale, a childless king and queen pray to God for a son until they are expecting one. After the prince's birth, an astrologer predicts he will marry by his twentieth year and kill his wife, otherwise he will turn into a dragon. The royal couple become gravely worried about their son's future, but he lives out his days until he is 20 years old, when they arrange a marriage between him and the queen of England. The queen of England, however, has a magical talking filly who tells the queen about her betrothed's fate, and plots with her to have her ride on horseback to church. Following the filly's instructions, the queen rides to church and holds tight to the horse's neck; they ride like lightning away from the prince who, just as foretold, becomes a dragon. Back to the queen, the filly advises her to trade her royal clothes with a farmer, and to work as a stableboy in a nearby kingdom. The queen obeys. In this second kingdom, the king's son suspects the new stableboy is a female, and sets some tests to prove his gender: to have him make a bouquet of flowers, to cut the bread a certain way, and to practice fence with him. With the filly's advice, the queen of England avoids revealing her gender, but she does anyway and marries the king's son. After a while, war breaks out, and the king's son borrows the queen of England's filly as his mount. Before they depart, the filly gives the queen three hairs of its mane to use in an emergency. While the king's son is away at war, the queen gives birth to \"beautiful\" twins, and writes her husband a letter. The messenger, however, is intercepted by the now draconic prince, who falsifies a sequence of letters that culminates with the queen and her children being ordered to be burned at a pyre. The queen's mother-in-law decides to spare them and sets them adrift on a boat with provisions, while they burn dummies in the pyre. Now adrift at sea, the dragon is ready to attack the queen of England and her children, butshe breaks out each of the filly's three hairs to create magic obstacles: first, a thicket, then a wide river and a mighty fire, but the dragon goes through each one. To the queen's relief, her friend, the filly, appears in the nick of time to battle to the dragon to the death: the dragon dies, but so does the filly. The queen cries over her dead friend, but notices that a castle appeared nearby. A woman at a window signs the queen to enter it, and welcomes her, saying she is the filly, but now her enchantment was over since she killed the dragon. Back to the king's son, he returns from war and learns of the false letters, and decides to sail the seas until he finds his wife. He sails to the shore where he sees the dead bodies of the dragon and the filly, and the castle in the distance, where he reunited with his family. Mari people. Scholar S. S. Sabitov located a similar narrative in the \"Catalogue of Tales of Magic from the Mari people\", indexed as a single entry of type 621, \"Шкура вши\" (\"Louseskin)\": a king sets a riddle for suitors to guess the material of the louseskin; the devil guesses it right and gains the princess as his bride, but she escapes with the help of a horse to another kingdom, where she marries a human prince. Asia. In their commentaries to the tales collected by the Grimm Brothers, European scholars Johannes Bolte and Jiri Polívka noted similarities between Turkish tale Kamer-Taj, der Mondross and Kyrgyz (sic) tale Dudar Kys, and the connection between both stories to the German tale Die Mädchen ohne Hände (\"The Maiden Without Hands\"). Turkey. Folklorist Ignác Kúnos published a similar tale from Turkey, with the title A hold-paripa, translated as Kamer-Taj, der Mondross, or the Moon-Horse. In this tale, a padishah fattens a flea for it to grow large, skins it and uses its leather as part of a riddle: whoever guesses it right, shall marry his daughter. A dev guesses it right and takes the padishah's daughter as his bride. The padishah's daughter mounts on her father's horse, Kamer-Taj or Moon-Horse, and it rides with the girl to a garden in a palace in another island. The prince who lives in this palace sees the horse and the princess and mistakes her for a peri. The girl explains she escaped from a horrible mistake of a wedding, and marries the prince. Some time later, war breaks out, and the prince goes in his father's stead. While the prince is away at war, his wife gives birth to a boy and a girl, but a sequence of forged letters by the dew threatens to destroy the girl and her children. After reading the false letters, the princess leaves the palace with her children. Lost in the world, the dew finds her and tries to kill her children. The princess cries out for her horse Kamer-Taj to help her, and the horse races to its mistress. Kamer-Taj takes them as far away as possible, to his own country. With no more strength in his body, Kamer-Taj asks the girl to use its head and entrails to magically build a palace for her and her children. In a monograph published posthumously, French comparativist Emmanuel Cosquin compared the Basque tale Le Pou with the Turkish Kamer-tag (sic) and concluded, based on the great parallels of both tales, that their relationship was \"incontestable\" (\"indubitable\", in the original). Kurdish people. Kurdologists Ordîxanê Jalîl, Celîlê Celîl and Zine Jalil collected a similar story from the Kurdish people. In this tale, titled \"Зэль­фи­наз и Джэль­фи­фараз\" (\"Zelfinaz and Jelfifaraz\"), a padishah laments that he has neither a son, nor a daughter. A dervish appears and gives him an apple: half to be given to his wife, and half to his mare, so that a daughter and a foal are born at the same time, and they are only to be named in his presence. The padishah agrees with the man's terms and takes the apple. Some time later, a girl is born to him, and a foal to his mare. When she is of age, the old man appears again and names the girl Zelfinaz and the horse Jelfifaraz, and asks the padishah to not reveal their names, but to give his daughter along with the horse to anyone who can guess their names. A dev learns of this, and sends his grayhound to spy on the princess and gather information. The grayhound comes back with the correct names, and the dev appears in court to answer the riddle. He guesses them correctly and takes the princess as his wife and her horse with him. Zelfinaz is given masculine clothes, and the horse - whom she calls \"her brother\" - hatches a plan with her: they will trick the dev, hit him and escape. It happens so: Jelfifaraz takes Zelfinaz to another king's palace, where she, in a man's garments, becomes the companion of the prince. The prince and his mother argue about whether or not his newfound companion is a woman, and she sets tests for \"him\": to drink wine and not get drunk, and to sleep on a branch of roses. With her horse's advice, she passes on both tests, but fails when she is put to the drinking test again: she is taken by the king's son to her chambers and undresses; the king's son realizes she is a girl, and sleeps by her side. The next morning, Zelfinaz wakes up and goes to see her \"brother\", the horsse, and apologizes for not talking to him the night before. The horse assuages her fears and tells her she has found her happiness. Time passes, and Zelfinaz marries the king's son. One day, her husband wants to go to the hajj and take Jelfifaraz with him. Despite some reservations, Zelfinaz agrees to let her husband take the horse with him. While he is away, she gives birth to two golden-haired sons, and her mother-in-law writes the prince a letter with the good news. However, the spurned dev strikes again, and forges a series of letters that cause Zelfinaz's exile with her children: she is given provisions for 40 days and nights, and put on a boat. She reaches a shore and laments her fate. Her brother, the horse, appears to her, and tells her to sacrifice him: cut open his insides and scatter them to create a garden, then clean his body and enter inside with her children. Jelfifaraz perishes, and Zelfinaz follows his orders. The next day, she wakes up in a palace. Safe for now, she raises her twin sons. Meanwhile, back to the prince, he learns of the false letters and begins a journey to find Zelfinaz. He takes a boat and sails the waters, until he reaches the same shore and finds Zelfinaz's palace, with their children inside. Turkestan. Orientalist Nikolai Ostroumov translated a similar tale into Russian with the title \"Царская дочь и Див\" (\"The Tsar's Daughter and the Div\"), which he sourced from the Sarts. In this tale, a king has a daughter and makes a suitor riddle for whoever wants to marry her: he fattens a louse, kills it and extends its skin, so people have to guess what material it is made of. A div spies on some servants gossiping about the secret and learns the answer, then wins the princess for himself. The princess is given to him, but, before she leaves, her magic talking horse advises her to take the horse with her and some objects (a mirror, a comb, salt, and a \"kalyampur-munchak\", which is a type of fragrant flower). She rides the horse to the dev's cave, where there are bones of the dev's victims, then makes a turn for it and escapes on it. The dev chases after them, but the horse advises her to throw the objects behind to stop him: the flower creates a field of thorns, the salt a sea of sand and salt, the comb a large mountain, and the mirror a river between them. Safe for now on the other side of the river, the princess finds shelter with an old couple. Some time later, a local king discovers her and marries her, paying a bride price to the old couple. One day, the king wants to take her horse on a hunt, but she does not wish to part with it. The animal gives some of its hairs to her, and leaves with the king. Meanwhile, back to the div, he survives the river crossing and reaches the princess's kingdom. When she gives birth to twin sons, a messenger is tasked with taking a letter to the king. The dev intercepts the letters and falsifies them to write a command to expel the princess and her children on a donkey, thenset them away from the kingdom. The false orders are carried out, and the princess leaves the kingdom on the donkey. On her exile, the div finds her and threatens to devour her and her children, but the princess tricks him into getting the proper materials to cook them, like firewood. While the div is busy collecting firewood, the princess burns the horse's hair and it appears immediately to help her. The horse and the div engage in battle, the horse winning, but it tells the princess to kill it, throw its head on one side, its legs on the four directions, spread its entrails, and sleep with her children inside its ribs. The princess refuses to do it at first, but goes through with it. The next morning, the legs become poplar trees with emerald ribs, the ribcage a golden palace, the entrails a garden, and the head a large stream. German-Bohemian folklorist Gustav Jungbauer translated the tale into German as Der Zauberross (\"The Magic Horse\"), sourcing it from Turkestan. In his commentaries, Jungbauer noted that this tale resembled both the Turkish Kamer-Taj and Kazakh Dudar-Kyz. Psychologist Marie-Louise von Franz sourced the tale The Magic Horse from Uzbekistan. Kumyk people. In a tale from the Kumyks, collected in Dagestan with the Kumyk title \"Къара атлы къыз\" (transliteration: \"Kara atly kyz\"; Russian: Девушка на вороном коне, romanized: Devushka na voronom kone, lit. 'The girl on the (raven-)black horse'), a dervish gives an apple to a childless couple, whose half is to be given to the wife, while the other is eaten by a mare in the stables. The heroine is born, also a black horse, and they become friends. At a certain point of the tale, she marries and gives birth to twin children, a boy with golden locks and a girl with a moon on the forehead. Some time later, she is forced to flee for her life, and rides away on her horse to another land. After the flight, the horse says it can help her one last time: he advises her to kill it, skin its body, take its tail and draw a large circle on the ground with it, then cover herself with its skin in the center of the circle and sleep. The heroine follows its orders and sleeps in the horseskin. The next morning, she sees that a palace has appeared overnight, with a lush and beautiful garden filled with animals, and inside the palace, her children are sleeping on a golden bed, and many servants are waiting at her beck and call. Buryat people. A similar narrative was collected from the Buryat, collected from a 62-year-old-teller in 1978, in the then Mongolian People's Republic, with the title \"Девушка и говорящий бархатисто-черный конь\" or \"Хэли мэдэдэг хэлин х хара моритой басаган\" (\"The Girl and her talking silky black horse\"). In this tale, a maiden lives with her parents, who are visited by a man named Badarchi Lama. He convinces the girl's parents to expel her from home, under the pretense that she is an evil spirit. The maiden is helped by a talking horse and escapes before her parents do anything to her. With the horse's help, she competes in a male-only tournament (a ploy by the khan to unmask his prophecised daughter-in-law). As the tale continues, the virago maiden gives birth to a boy with golden breast and silver backside, and her husband takes her magical horse to help him in a war. The same Badarchi Lama intercepts the royal mail and falsifies a letter with an order to dig a hole and bury queen and son inside it. They carry out the order, but the magical black horse, back from the war, rescues them out of the pit and escapes with both to the distant mountains. Now at a safe distance, the horse tells them it is about to expire, and asks the girl to use its remains to build them a house: place its four legs on the four cardinal points to create four sandalwood trees, place its head in the middle to create crystal, spread its skin on the ground and sleep on its body. The next day, four sandalwood trees appear, and she climbs one, just as the sholmos (the evil priest) appears with an axe to fell the tree the girl and her son are on. After he tries a bit, a wolf agrees to help him, and the sholmos rests for a bit. The wolf flees with the axe, and the sholmos spews another from his mouth. The second time, a red fox offers to take the sholmos's place in felling the tree, but the animal also escapes. The third time, the sholmos cuts down the third sandalwood tree, and mother and son move out to the fourth and last one. While waiting on the treetop, two dogs come to their rescue: they dig out a hole in the ground and fill it water, saying that red and white foam will pool at the surface; if it is red foam, the dogs have been defeated. The canines drag the sholmos to the hole, kill him, and jump out of the hole, telling the girl and her son they are free to live. Finally, the girl's husband returns home and learns of the exchanged letters, and sends emissaries to the four corners of the earth to find her. The emissaries find the girl in the mountains, but she refuses to return, due to the false orders being carried out. Her father-in-law and her husband go in person to solve the misunderstanding and everybody goes back home. Mongolia. In a Mongolian tale translated as \"Жеребёнок-спаситель\" (\"The Saviour Colt\"), an old couple have a beautiful daughter. They also have a mare with no foal, and a tree with no fruit. One day, the old man sees that the mare has foaled and the tree yielded fruit. His daughter wants to see the foal, but her father tells her to see it tomorrow. In the middle of the night, the daughter sneaks out to see the foal, which is of a bay colour, and eats the fruits from the tree. Suddenly, the horse talks to her and says the mangas will come in the night, and they should escape. The daughter agrees and takes with her a comb and a whetstone, as per the horse's instructions. She rides the horse and accidentally drops the comb to create a sea of boiling water in front of them. The horse jumps over the sea and tells her to throw the whetstone behind them. Eventually, they reach another kingdom. The horse explains that, in this kingdom, the khan and the khansha are looking for a bride for their son. The horse suggests that she will become the wife of the khan's son, and reminds her to not allow her husband to ride it, nor fetter it with iron chains. The girl marries the khan's son. One day, the girl is pregnant, and the khan's son has to depart on a three year journey. He and asks if he can borrow her horse. She agrees to lend the horse to her husband, but asks him to not put the horse in iron fetters. While he is away, she gives birth to a son, and writes her husband a letter. The letter is intercepted by the mangas. The horse races back to the girl and her son, and tells her to mount him, for the mangas are coming for her. The horse races to the middle of the vast steppe, and tells the girl he will son perish. However, she can use his four legs to create four aspens (one of gold, one of silver, one of pearls and one of coral), and his body to become a sea. The horse also gives her four golden hairs of its mane. After the horse dies, the girl uses its legs and body to create an island in the middle of a sea, with four aspens. She climbs up the golden aspen, when suddenly the mangas comes and gnaws at the tree trunk to fell it down. The girl and her son jump to the silver one, then the coral one, and finally to the pearl one, the mangas destroying the other aspens until there is only the pearl one. In the nick of time, two dogs cross the sea and attack the mangas, ripping it to pieces. The girl traverses the sea with the dogs and recognizes a man on a horse: it is her husband, who has come to rescue her.In another Mongolian tale translated as Die achtzehnjährige Aigalzoo (\"Eighteen-year-old Aigalzu\"), a prince and a princess have a beautiful daughter namd Aigalzu, whom they raised in a glass house to protect her from the world. When she comes of age, they decide to marry her, and set a test for any potential suitors: to guess her name and age. A poor monk discovers her name and guesses it right. Her mother and father lament this situation, since a monk's life is a hard one. She takes with her a mirror shard, a flint and a comb, and goes to live with the monk. After three years, she decides to visit her parents, and escapes from the monk. Her husband pursues her, and she throws the mirror shard, the flint and the comb to create magical obstacle to hinder the pursuit. She takes shelter with an old woman, who adopts her as her child, since the old woman's son died in the war fighting for another prince. Aigalzu finds the old woman's dead son's bow and arrow, and is given a talking horse. The old woman talls the girl the prince visits her once a month and must not know she is a girl, so she needs to dress in masculine clothes. Her horse also advises Aigalzu to act masculine and show interest in masculine activities. Eventually she is unmasked and marries the prince. One day, the prince has to travel abroad and asks Aigalzu to borrow her horse. The horse agrees to be lent, but the prince must not tie him in iron chains. Aigalzu gives birth to a boy and her mother-in-law writes her son a letter with the good news. However, the letter is intercepted by the same monk Aigalzu spurred once. the monk falsifies a series of letters, which culminates with Aigalzu and her son escaping from the palace on her talking horse. During the ride, she realizes that one of the horse's legs is stripped bare of its flesh, due to the iron chains the horse was fettered to. At a certain distance, the horse loses its strength and tells Aigalzu, after it dies, to use its eyes to create two ravens, its ears to create two foxes, its nostrils to create two tigers, its four legs to create four sandal trees, its skin to create a verdant meadow, its heart and liver to create a rock, and its blood to create a red sea. She obeys the horse's instructions. Some time later, the monk appears in the meadow. Aigalzu and her son climb the four sandal trees to escape from the monk, who chops down each tree with an axe. Nanai people. Researcher Kira Van Deusen collected a Nanai tale from storyteller Anna Petrovna Khodzher. In her tale, titled Endohochen, two sisters live together. One day, a creature named Endohochen steals the tongue of one of the sisters. One night, she has a dream about an old woman. The old woman tells her she will give her a white horse, and that she can get her own tongue back. Eventually, she gets her tongue back and  escapes on the white horse to a village. The girl, named Pudin, marries a man named Mergen and bears him a son. Endohochen goes after her, and Pudin cries out for the white horse to save her. The horse races to her with all its might, and takes her away. At a safe distance, the horse tells her he has lost all his strength, and asks Pudin to kill him and wrap his skin around her and the baby. She follows the horse's request and sleeps in the horsekin. When she wakes up, Pudin notices she is now in a fine house. Van Deusen noted that the name of the heroine, Pudin (or Pudi, and Fudin), is given to the heroine in Nanai tales; that the narrative sequence with the horse is similar to \"epic heroines among the Turks and Mongols\", and that the episode of the exchanged letters is reminiscent of the European tale The Handless Maiden. Nepal. In a tale from Nepal with the title \"ДЕВУШКА И БРАТЬЯ-ДЕМОНЫ\" (\"The Girl and the Demon-Brothers\"), a mother has a beautiful daughter that is wooed by many suitors, but she refuses every romantic advance. One day, three demon brothers disguise themselves as humans and try to court the girl. Her mother agrees to their courtship, but first they have to guess her daughter's name. The demon brothers ask a hare, a fox and a magpie if they can spy on the girl and her mother. The hare and the fox fail, but the magpie learns: \"Flower of Paradise\". They guess it right and the mother gives her daughter to the demon brothers. As a parting gift, the mother gives her daughter a white horse. Flower of Paradise lives a hellish marital life: every chore is thrust on her, and she is chastised for everything. One day, while the demon brothers are away, she opens a door and sees a pile of human bones. She cries that she may share such grim fate, but her mother's voice, coming from her apron, tells her to take the white horse and escape. She wears the apron on her to take the shape of an old lady and flees with the horse to another kingdom. There, she takes the job as a servnant in the palace. As her pastime, she goes to the river, takes off the apron, and combs her hair by the water. A shepherd notices the beautiful girl at the river, and tells the monarch about it. The monarch goes to the river and sees Flower of Paradise. He learns of her story and marries her. Some time later, he has to travel afar, to the other side of his dominions. While he is away, Flower of Paradise gives birth to a boy and writes her husband a letter. The messenger takes the letter and journeys to meet the monarch, but stops by a tree where three men are drinking wine. By getting the messenger drunk, the three men - the demon brothers - discover the location of Flower of Paradise and falsify the messenger's letters. Flower of Paradise receives a false letter with a message to get her son and leave the kingdom. Wondering about the strange letter, she decides to obey it anyway and departs with her son on the white horse. The white horse stops at a desert and asks Flower of Paradise to kill him, and spread his skin, bones and hooves on the four corners, and his mane around it. She obeys the horse's orders and, the next day, she and her son wake up in comfortable beds in a grand palace. Eventually, the monarch finds Flower of Paradise and their son in the grand palace. At the end of the tale, they are visited by three men, which Flower of Paradise recognizes as the demon-brothers, by looking at a scar on the hand of one of the men. The girl plots with her husband how to get rid of the demon brothers: they dig out a hole in the ground, draw the demon brothers there. They fall inside, and Flower of Paradise's servants close the hole on the demons.In another Nepalese tale, collected in Dsarkot, Mustang, and translated into German with the title Die schöne Men Suka Drönyok (\"The Beautiful Men Suka Drönyok\"), a king named Benda Horki Gyewo has three sons, each promising to marry brides of their own choice: the elder, a rich one; the middle one, a smart one; the youngest, a beautiful one. Meawhile, Men Suka Drönyok's father sets a riddle for her potential suitors: whoever guesses her name right, shall marry her. A demon comes to try his luck in marrying the girl, and Men Suka's father gives him three chances, one on each day. The demon threatens a \"Kojote\" into revealing the girl's name: twice the animal forgets her name, but on the third time he learns of her true name and informs the demon. The creature comes to court Men Suka and gives the correct answer, taking the girl with him. They pass by a golden palace and one of mother-of-pearl, until they reach a castle made of dog excrement. Despite the foul appearance, its interior is indeed luxurious. Settling in her new life, Men Suka is given a key to all rooms by the demon, and he leaves on a hunt. While he is away, she finds a rusty key to a strange room. She uses it and finds inside piles of corpses from humans and horses alike, all belonging to his victims. A still alive victim sees Men Suka and orders her to flee. The girl obeys: she places a mannequin dressed like her, wears an old woman disguise and fools her demonic husband, then escapes to another kingdom, where Benda Horki Gyewo's three sons live. The girl is hired as a shepherdess and is made to look after the dogs and cows. The animals get fatter and healthier than before, and she is made to look after the swine. The youngest prince finds Men Suka's old woman disguise, and marries her. Later, the king sets three tasks for the three princes to determine who shall succeed him: Men Suk helps her husband and fulfills her father-in-law's task, allowing her husband to ascend to the throne. Later, when her husband is away at some royal business, Men Suka gives birth to boy with an upper body part of gold, the lower part of silver, and forehead made of mother-of-pearl. A sequence of falsified letters writes that she gave birth to objects, and Men Suka receives a false reply telling her to throw the boy beyond 9 mountains and valleys. Men Suka escapes with her son on a horse and meets an old man on the road (her previous fiancé, the demon). The old man swallows the child, but Men Suka kils him with a pin. A horse she has herded in the past accompanies her and, as a last help to its mistress, asks Men Suka to kill it, spread its entrails on the edges of the meadow, and place its kidneys on the right and on the left, its head in the middle, and its four legs on the four cardinal points. Men Suka follows its directions and sacrifices the horse; its body parts create a palace for her and her son, a tiger and a leopard its guards and subjects from drops of the horse's blood. Later, her husband wanders off until he finds the newly built palace, and reunites with his wife, Men Suka, and their son. Tibet. According to Hungarian orientalist László L. Lőrincz, professor Damdinsuren published a Tibetan language translation of The Bewitched Corpse, titled Ro-sgruṅ. Its tenth tale is titled, in the original, Bu-mo So-kha 'di-li sman-čaṅ šes rtas srin-mo'i lag-nas bral-te rgyal-srid sprad-pa'i le'u žugs (French: Comment la fille So-kha 'di-li sman-čaṅ échappa à l'aide du cheval fée au démon et obtint le trône; English: \"How the girl So-kha 'di-li sman-čaṅ escaped from the devil with the help of a magical horse and gained the throne\"). Lörincz also provided an abridged summary of the tale: a demon in disguise guesses the true name of the girl with the help of a fox and they marry; So-kha 'di-li sman-čaṅ rides her own magical horse away from him and marries a human king; while the king is away at war, she gives birth to a boy and writes her husband a letter; the letter is intercepted and falsified by the demon, who goes after them; the magical horse saves So-kha 'di-li sman-čaṅ and her son.Tibetologist Yuri Parfionovich published a similar tale in the compilation \"Игра Веталы с человеком\" (\"Vetala's Game with a Man\"), with the title \"Три брата-демона\" (\"The Three Demon Brothers\"), sourced from Tibet: the titular three demon brothers cheat and obtain the answer to a suitor riddle by guessing the heroine's name; the heroine goes to the demon brothers' house, finds a cellar filled with bones, escapes to another kingdom, where she meets and marries the local king; after the king takes a leave of absence, the queen writes him a series of letters informing of the birth of their son, but the demon brothers intercept the letters and falsify them; after reading the letters, the heroine flees from her kingdom with her son and a horse; at a distance, the horse explains the heroine must sacrifice it, take its body parts and spread them around her; at last, with the horse's sacrifice, the heroine and her son find a castle nearby. Author James Riordan translated the tale to English as Lotus Blossom (also the heroine's name), and also sourced it from Tibet. In another translated version, titled The Three Evil Brothers, the heroine's name is \"Lhasa Flower\". Kazakhstan. In a Kazakh tale translated into Hungarian with the title A fakó lovacska (\"The White Horse\"), a rich man has much cattle and properties, but no children. People wonder why the man has not suffered any cattle theft, and attribute his success to a white horse he owns. One day, he is invited to the khan's banquet, but cannot sit anywhere since he has no son, nor daughter. The man and his wife make a cattle offering and pray to God for a child. In a vision, a voice tells him that if he performs a certain deed, he will be granted a daughter. So a daughter is born to him. Years later, she proclaims she is her own master, and becomes a beautiful young woman that is courted by many suitors. She sets a riddle for her suitor: they are to guess her name. She tells her parents her name is Dudar Kyz. One day, when her caravan moves from place to place, the name Dudar Kyz is shouted, and the girl thinks someone called her. Some time later, a suitor comes to guess her name, and gets it right. Before she leaves with her bridegroom, she talks to her white horse about the bridegroom. The horse reveals the bridegroom is a wicked wolf that took on human shape, and the equine advises her go ask her father for some items to take with her to her new home: a bow and arrow, a black servant on a black camel, and the white horse. She rides the white horse to her new home, her suitor ahead of her. He becomes a wolf, devours the black camel and turns back to human. They reach his tent, and his elder wife asks to tie Dudar's horse. Dudar's declines and ties the horse outside the yurt, and remains there. While her husband wakes up screaming for Dudar Kyz, the girl, still outside, dons male clothing and goes with the horse far away from the tent. She meets another youth during a hunt. She kills two animals as game for herself, and the youth, named Tostuk, is so impressedby the feat he suggests they become brothers. Tostuk takes Dudar Kyz (in male disguise) to his tent, and his mother suspects her son's new friend is a girl. Dudar Kyz and Tostuk take part in a test set by another khan: whoever shoots a bag of money atop a tree, shall marry his daughter. Dudar Kyz wins and marries the khan's daughter. Dudar Kyz brings the khan's daughter with her to Tostuk's tent, and ponders about her situation. Her white horse advises her to reveal the truth to Tostuk. Dudar Kyz invites Tostuk to a ride in the steppe and shows him her true identity. Tostuk accepts her and marries both her and the khan's daughter. Some time later, war erutpts, and Tostuk is drafted, just as Dudar Kyz falls pregnant. Tostuk tells his mother to look after his wife and to name his son Altyn-Báj, takes Dudar Kyz's horse and rides to battle. While he is way, Dudar Kyz gives birth to a boy with golden head and silver chest. Her mother-in-law writes a letter to her son for a man to deliver it to him. The messenger gets the letter, but stops at a house that belongs to a bony witch, the mother of Dudar Kyz's rejected suitor. The messenger delivers Tostuk's mother's letter to him, and he writes a response. The messenger passes by the bony witch's house again and she falsifies Tostuk's response, writing a command to take Dudar Kyz and her son and burn them. Dudar Kuz reads the letter and cries. She hears the trot of her white horse. The animal comes, its legs badly hurt, and tells her to take Altyn-Báj and come with him. The horse rushes to whatever destination they can reach, and the bony witch appears to chase her. Dudar Kyz throws behind her a comb, which becomes a forest to delay the witch. Then, she drops a mirror and it becomes a lake. Dudar Kyz and the horse fall into the lake, and the bony witch grabs her arm. Dudar Kyz cuts her horse's belly; the horse strikes the witch with its hind legs; the witch lets go of her and sinks into the lake. At the other margin, the white horse, sensing its approaching death, asks Dudar Kyz to use its legs to create a herd of horses, and its chest to create a large white yurt for her and her son. After the horse perishes, she grieves for it three days, then follows his instructions: a yurt appears before the girl, where she raises her son Altyn-Báj. Eventually, Tostuk finds his wife and son again, after many years, and the family is reunited. Kyrgyzstan. Turkologist Vasily Radlov first collected the tale Dudar Kys in the late 19th century, and sourced it from Kyrgyzstan.In another tale sourced from Kyrgysztan and collected in Turgay with the title \"Волкъ-женихъ\" (\"Wolf Bridegroom\"), a rich old man wants to marry his daughter, Ганиф (Hanif), to a possible suitor, but sets a test for them: he fashions a pair of gloves of louseskin, and any suitor must guess their material. Hanif complains to a friend about the louseskin gloves, but their conversation is overheard by two wolves. The wolves shapeshift into humans and go to the rich man's tent to win Hanif. One of the human wolves answers correctly and prepares to take the girl to his own yurt. After moving out to her bridegroom's yurt, Hanif discovers her bridegroom and his friend are wolves. Her horse warns her to take a ring and a brooch from the yurt and escape. Hanif throws behind the items and misses her pursuers. Now at a distance, the horse feels it cannot go on, and urges Hanif to kill it, eat his flesh and drink his blood, spill the rest of the blood around her, rip open its belly and extract its entrails. She then needs to cover herself in the horse's belly and hold its right leg next to her. Hanif refuses to fulfill her horse's dying request, but eventually does it. The next morning, the horse's belly becomes a magnificent kibitk, the horse leg becomes a handsome youth and the drops of blood all around her becomes a nation of people that choose her as their ruler. Iran. Researcher Adrienne Boulvin summrized an Iranian tale from Meched (Mashhad, formerly in the Khorasan province, modern day Razavi Khorasan province), with the title La Peau de la Puce (\"The Louseskin\"). In this tale, a king is bitten by a louse, captures it and fattens it until it is large enough, then kills it and prepares a riddle for any suitor: they must guess the material of the large hide exposed on the city's gates, then they shall marry the princess. A div overhears the vizir talking about the secret to his wife, and learns of the correct answer. The div guesses it right and takes the princess as his bride. With the help of a magic horse, she escapes from the div, who tries to get her. To delay his pursuit, the princess throws behind her a needle to create a field of needles, a bit of salt to create a cover of salt, and waterjug to create a sea between them. The princess manages to escape on the magic horse, and the tale ends.Professor Mahomed-Nuri Osmanovich Osmanov translated an Iranian tale into Russian with the title \"Козни дервиша\" (\"The Intrigue of a Dervish\"). In this tale, an old padishah has 40 wives and no children. A dervish appears to him and gives him an apple, to be divided in half and each half cut in 40 pieces, and to give each piece to his 40 wives and 40 mares, but he demands one child and one horse as payment. The padishah agrees and follows the dervish's orders: the next year, his 40 wives are heavy with child, as well as his mares. The dervish appears to get his due, and chooses a girl and a colt, taking them with him. The dervish rides the colt to a garden, then dismounts the horse to look for a key to open the garden. While he is away, the colt warns the girl the dervish wants to kill her, and they make their escape to another kingdom. The colt advises her to put on men's clothes, and gives her some of its hairs. The girl-as-man becomes friends with another padishah's son during a hunt, who believes he is a youth, and invites him in to his palace. The prince's mother suspects that is a girl, but the princess remains quiet about it. Some time later, the kingdom is attack by another king, and the colt tells its rider they will join the battle and win. The princess and her horse defeat the enemies, and goes back to her room. Her friend, the prince goes to check on his friend, and discovers her true gender. He reports to his mother, who admits she was right. The prince and princess celebrate their betrothal in a grand ceremony, but the prince has to leave for a while. Back to the dervish, he found the key to the gate, but finds out that the girl and the colt have vanished, so he goes after them. He stops by a four-path crossroads, and sees a messenger coming. He convinces the messenger to stop for a while, and gives him a soporific drink, so he can check into his letters. The dervish finds a letter addressed to the princess, and falsifies it, leading to a sequence of forged missives that state that the prince thinks that the princess is having an affair, and writes an order to burn her alive. The princess gets the false letters, and decides to submit to her fate. During the execution, the princess throws one of the colt's hairs into the fire; the animal appears before her and they ride together away to a river margin. The colt says it will soon perish, and declares that its body will become a palace to house her, and its two ears musicians and singers. It happens thus, and the princess lives in the palace. Meanwhile, her betrothed discovers the series of forged letters and, thinking the princess was killed, hangs the messenger and becomes a wanderer in the desert. The princess leaves the palace to wander the desert, and meets the prince as he is drinking from a stream. Balochistan. In a tale from Balochistan with the title \"Китайское дерево\" (\"Chinese Tree\"), a ruler falls deep into his own grief for not having children he becomes a dervish in the middle of the road. A creature named malang appears to him, is told of his problem and gives the ruler two pomegranates, one for him and the other to be divided and given to his wives and the mares in his stables. In exchange, the ruler is to deliver him his firstborn and the foal that his beloved mare will give birth to. The ruler accepts the malang's deal and gives the pomegranates to his wives: a girl is born to his beloved wife, and a filly to his beloved horse. Unwilling to part with his daughter, he raises her secretly in a dungeon. The girl grows up a beautiful maiden, and the malang goes to the king under a beggar disguise to remind him of his promise: his daughter and the mare. The king tries to offer the malang one of his sons, but the creature wants the girl. Thus, the girl and the mare are delivered to him. They pass by a graveyard, and a skull cries in joy, then sheds tears. The princess inquires the skull about it and it answers it was happy for her beauty, and sad for the girl's unfortunate fate: to be devoured by the malang or live in a grave with him, then, as parting words, tells her to obey her mare's advice. The girl and the mare reach the malang's house, a grave, and he shoves her in. After the malang leaves, the mare begins to speak and says it will take the princess to safety, as swift as the wind. The mare takes the princess to another city, where she sells her belongings and buys male clothes, passing herself off as a man. She, in male disguise, befriends the local prince. The prince's father, however, suspects she is a girl, and sets tests for her: to choose between women's apparel and men's weapons; and to choose between delicacies for men and those for women. With the mare's neigh, the girl passes the first test, but sleeps through the second and is discovered. Still, the prince marries her. The mare then tells her mistress not to loan it to anyone, but, one day, the prince, her husband, has to travel to another land, and borrows his wife's per mare. While he is away, the princess gives birth to twin sons, and sends a letter to inform her husband. The messenger begins his journey, but stops to rest under a \"Chinese tree\". The malang appears and intercepts the letters to cause the princess to flee from the kingdom. It happens thus: the princess reads the false letter and runs away with her twin children, a saddle and a bridle. During her exile, she meets the same malang under the Chinese tree. The malang attacks her, and the mare, which sensed her mistress was in danger, rushes back to her aid and kills the malang, not before it stabs the horse. At its last breaths, the mare asks the princess to open up its belly, take out the entrails and spread them around to create a garden, and then enter its skin with her children. The next day, a palace springs up, surrounded by a beautiful garden. Back to her husband, after he learns of the exchanged letters, goes afters his wife and finds the palace near the Chinese tree. He then reunites with his family. Uzbekistan. In an Uzbek tale titled \"Черный волшебный конь\" (\"The Black Magic Horse\"), collected by Uzbek folklorist Muzayyana Alaviya, a padishah suffers for not having any child, until a qalander comes to his palace and predicts he shall father a girl, and warns him he shall not deny anything she asks of him. The qalander gives the padishah an apple, whose half the padishah eats and his wife the other half. They have a daughter they call Mushkiya (\"fragrant\"). One day, the maidservants find a louse in her hair. Mushkiya decides to fatten it, skin it and make a carpet as part of a suitor riddle. To keep the secret, Mushkiya orders her nanny to be taken to desert. Out of pity, another servant simply abandons the nanny in the desert and brings back a bloodied kerchief. Still in the desert, the \"Wolf King\" approaches her and she tells the answer to the princess's riddle. The Wolf King and his pack come to the palace to woo the princess, and he guesses it right. The  padishah shames his daughter for such a foolish whim, but she says she will consult with a vizier. The vizier advises her to get a magic black horse - inherited from her ancestors - from the stables, a whip and garments; follow the wolf to its den on a horse, but not dismount it, then ride the horse towards any unknown destination. Mushkiya rides the magic black horse after her wolf suitor to its cave, and before she dismounts, she puts her plans into action: pretending to \"exorcize\" evil spirits from the wolf's cave, she whips her horse three times, each time the horse soaring high in the sky, then flying away. Meanwhile, in another kingdom, a widowed kingdom is told by his wiseman that his future bride will come in a flying horse. The king meets the rider on the flying horse, and thinks they are male, instead of his prophesied bride. The king mistakes him for a male rider and tries to unmask her by some tests: by sitting next to him, and bathing in the river. Eventually, the king falls ill with love for the girl and she reveals herself. Mushkiya and the king marry. Some time later, the king has to leave on a misson around the kingdom, and leaves his wife to the court's care. After nine months, Mushkiya gives birth to male twins, Hassan and Husan, and the vizier writes him a letter. A messenger is assigned to take the letter to the king, but stops to rest by a lodge on the way. After the messenger delivers the true letter to the king, he passes by the same lodge, where the owner's daughter - a spurned suitor to the king - changes the king's missive for a false command to burn Mushkiya and her children at the stake. The vizier receives the letter and despite doubting its contents at first, decides to carry out the orders. Before the queen is burnt, her magic black horse takes her and the children elsewhere. At a safe distance, the horse says he is dying, and asks Mushkiya to bury his eyes to create two springs, his ears to create gates, strips of its skin to create a fortress-city and its mane to grant greater fortune. The horse dies, and Mushkiya separates its body parts;. Overnight, an entire fortified city appears to her, where she lives with the twins. Meanwhile, the king returns from his mission and, thinking his wife and sons are dead, decides to wander about as a beggar. He eventually goes to the new fortified city that appeared overnight and finds his wife and children. After a joyous reunion, the family is separated again: Mushkiya is kidnapped by a caravan; while trying to cross a river, the king loses both Hassan and Husan, and washes up in another kingdom; Hassan is stolen by a wolf, but saved by a huntsman; Husan is swallowed by a fish, but is saved by a fisherman. At the end of the tale, after a long time of separation, the family is reunited for good. Tajikistan. A similar tale is attested in a manuscript archived in the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Academy of Sciences of the then Soviet Union. The manuscript, indexed as B 4496, is dated to the 19th century, and written in coloquial Tajik. In a summary of the tale, titled \"Повесть об 'Аламарай\" (\"The Story of Alamaray\"), the women at her father's harem accuse princess Alamaray, and she is set to be executed. However, her horse, which is a Peri, rescues her and takes her to another kingdom, where she wears a masculine disguise and befriends a prince. The prince sets tests to determine his friend's identity. She passes the tests, but eventually reveals herself and marries the prince, giving birth to a son. Once again, she is slandered and walked to her execution, but her horse again saves her. Alamaray rules a magical city. Her husband finds her in the city, and meets their son. Khanty people. In a tale from the Khanty people collected in 1978 and published in 1990 with the title \"Золотой конь\" (\"Golden Horse\"), a girl finds a golden louse in her father's hair and blows it; it changes into a golden horse. They decide to set a riddle: whoever guesses the horse's origins shall marry the girl. An evil sorcerer overhears their conversation, comes to court the girl and guesses it right. Before she departs, the golden horse advises her to tie a large birch bark on her and let the sorcerer ride ahead. During the journey, the girl rides away with the horse and they are chased by the sorcerer, who only grabs the birch. Both escape to a royal city, where live the sons of Ort-iki. She asks for some food, drink and lodge in Ort-iki's house, and ends up marrying Ort-iki's youngest son. Some time later, the girl's husband has to go to war and borrows the golden horse, and is advised by the girl not to tie the horse to a thick tree trunk. While her husband is away at war, she gives birth to a boy with the moon on a cheek and the sun on the other, and a servant writes a letter to her husband with the good news. The evil sorcerer returns and falsifies a series of letters, with a command to expel the girl and her son from home. Ort-iki's messengers give him the false message, which the girl decides to carry out. She leaves home and wanders off, when her golden horse appears to her, his bridle tied to a thick trunk. The horse tells her it lost all strength, but advises her to cut open its flesh and enter its belly. The next day, she wakes up in a house, and her son shouts at her that his father is coming to visit them. However, the sorcerer appears for a last attack, and the girl cuts off his head with a sword. After burning the sorcerer's corpse, she welcomes her husband into her house. Ulch people. In an untitled tale from the Ulch people, an old man has an oldy daughter he wishes to marry to a rich man, but she wants to marry a poor man, and they argue for it. One day, the daughter finds a louse on her father's hair, which he uses to make a shaman drum as part of a suitor riddle: whoever guesses it right, shall marry his daughter. The girl's father is rich, and his servants gossip about the riddle, which is eavesdropped on by two giants. When the servants go down to fetch water, the giants ask the maidservants the secret of the shaman drum. They servants refuse at first, but are threatened, so they reveal the answer. The giants tell the rich man the answer, and the girl is forced to go with them. However, before she leaves, she hides a bar, a quern, and cuts out an image of a horse in a piece of paper. A living horse appears to her, which she mounts to accompany the giants to their house. To distract them, the girl tells them to wait on the road, while she goes ahead and clear the house for them. Tricked by her words, the girl enters their house, but blows on her horse and gallops away from them. The giants discover the deception and run after her. The girl's horse begins to talk and warns her that the giants are after her, so she throws behind the objects hidden in her clothes to deter them: a bar that creates a mountain, an awl that becomes a net, and another bar that becomes a stone pillar. During the flight, her paper horse begins to tire, so she creates a few more to keep running. The girl climbs on the stone pillar to escape the giants. She has a last piece of paper on her, she fashions a last horse and rides it away to another land. At a distance, the horse tells the girl it will soon die, but asks her to use its blood to draw the image of a house and a barn, and for her to wrap its skin around her body. It happens thus: the girl sleeps in the horseskin, and wakes up in a fine house furnished with a fireplace and some skiis for her to hunt with. One day, she sees that her beloved poor suitor is coming to her, but behind her a giant on a boat behind him. The girl rushes to the barn, takes an arrow and shoot it at the giant. Free at last, the girl lives with her beloved and they have a son together. Americas. North America. Scholar Stanley Lynn Robe located a similar tale in America, published by  José Manuel Espinosa and sourced from New Mexico. In this tale, the devil comes to woo a girl in form of a boy. The girl accompanies him riding her own mule, which helps her escape from the devil by riding through rivers of blood, fire and blades. After they reach another kingdom, the girl disguises herself in male's clothes and the local prince tries to unmask her. The mule helps the girl in two occasions, but on the third the prince discovers the girl and they marry. West Indies. In a tale collected by folklorist Elsie Clews Parsons with the title The Horse that Rescues: Man or Woman? and sourced from Saint Kitts, a gentleman has a daughter who refuses any suitor. One day, a man with golden teeth comes to his house and asks for a glass of water. A servant gives him the glass, and the girl sees the golden teeth, then declares he is the one for her. The gentleman agrees to marry her, but insists she takes with her an old horse named Yellah Dander. Despite the girl's protests, she takes the horse with her. They ride to the man's house, then he retires to another room, and says he will send for her later. After he leaves, the horse begins to talk and reveals the golden-toothed man is the devil, and she is to wait until the servants come in. Five servants come in, then the man himself, and the horse tells the girl to take off a shoe and strike its behind with the heel, so that they may go back to her father's house. However, the girl kicks the horse with the sole of the shoe and they rush to another country. Before they enter the city, the horse advises the girl to go to the tailor for clothes and to a barber to shave her hair. She leaves her horse outside the city, and the animal advises her to say \"his\" father was the governor there once and \"he\" has come to claim the position. In her male disguise, she does as instructed and the people prepare a ball for her. The horse advises her not to dance after midnight, lest she be discovered as a woman. Next, they ask her to take a bath with the people, but, with the horse's advice, she manages to avoid being found out. At the end of the tale, the horse asks the girl to burn a rope with coal, then put the burnt the rope on it; after he burns down, she is to take the ashes, store them in a bag, then place the bag under her head, and she will find herself back home with the horse. The girl follows the instructions and both return to her father's house. Africa. In a Central African folktale collected by missionary Robert Hamill Nassau from the Mpongwe people with the title Leopard of the Fine Skin, in a town named Ra-Mborakinda, princess Ilâmbe demands to be married only to a man who has not any blemish on his skin. Her father, king Mborakinda, dislikes her behaviour, but lets her be. As such, many suitors have come to court her, and many have been spurned. Even animals begin to assume human shape to try to court her, until it is Leopard's turn. Leopard meets an old doctor named Ra-Marânge, who directs him to a sorcered named Ogula-ya-mpazya-vazya. The sorcerer prepares a medicine for Leopard and he becomes a human called Ogula-Njĕgâ. In human form, he goes to Ra-Mborakinda to court Ilâmbe, who falls in love with him since his body has not any spot or blemish. A marriage is arranged between them, but King Mborakinda, through his okove (a magic fetish), senses something evil regarding his daughter's marriage and pushes her aside for a talk: he gives her a key and tells her to unlock a house, where she will find two Kabala (magic horses) and she must choose the lame-looking one. Despite her questions, she obeys her father and takes the lame horse with her, along with a retinue of servants. On the road, Ogula-Njĕgâ, still feeling his animal instints despite being in human shape, tells his wife he go ahead of her; at a distance, he changes into a leopard, hunts some prey, then returns to his human wife as a human male. Some time later, the retinue arrives at Leopard's village, where all animals have transformed into humans by some magic. Princess Ilâmbe falls into a routine where she stays at home, while Ogula-Njĕgâ lies he has business in another town, turns into a leopard to hunt prey, then comes home. Time passes, and Ilâmbe wishes to have aa food-plantation and orders her servants to dig up the ground, but her servants start disappearing - her husband's doing. After many disappearances, Ilâmbe begins to feel lonely and pets her Horse as a friend. The horse begins to speak in a human voice and tells her the servants have been devoured by her husband, and that, after her close maidservants vanish too, she will be the last. It happens as the horse described; the horse then advises Ilâmbe to prepare three gourds: one with ground-nuts, the second with gourd seeds and the third with water. The next day, Ogula-Njĕgâ's mother tells him she suspects something about his wife and the horse, but sleeps next to her. The following day, Ogula-Njĕgâ goes about his \"business\"; while he is away, Ilâmbe escapes with her Horse and the gourds. Ogula-Njĕgâ comes home and, noticing his wife's absence, turns into a leopard and rushes after her. The Horse senses the pursuit and orders Ilâmbe to throw the gourds behind them, one after the other: the Leopard eats the contents of the first two and the third breaks apart and creates a large stream between them. The Horse brings Ilâmbe to another village where only men may enter, and changes her gender to a male. Ilâmbe rides the Horse into the village and takes shelter with a youth, who begins to suspect the newcomer is a woman, not a man, so he sets tests to unmask their gender: to bathe in the river with the men. With the horse's magic, Ilâmbe truly becomes a man and avoids any discovery. Later, the Horse asks her to shoot him, cut up his flesh and burn it, then take his ashes and scatter them outside the village. Ilâmbe follows the horse's instructions: she turns back into a woman, and appears mounted on Horse. They return to Ra-Mborakinda and Ilâmbe sees the error of her behaviour. Adaptations. British author Alan Garner developed a literary treatment of the narrative with the tale The Princess and the Golden Mane. In this tale, a princess falls in love with a stableboy, much to her father's, the king, disgust. They marry in secret, and he has to leave her. Before he departs, the stableboy tells his wife she will bear twins, a boy and a girl, and she can trust a golden-maned white horse from the stable to save her and their children. The king learns of the pregnancy and orders his knights to search far and wide for the stableboy, to no avail. Time passes. As petty revenge against his daughter, the king fattens a louse until it is large enough, kills it and uses its hide as part of a riddle: anyone who can guess the animal the hide belongs to, shall marry the princess. A strange beggarman comes to court and guesses it right. Fearing for her children, the princess consults with the golden-maned horse, which advises her to take it with her, since the beggarman will want to take only the children. Despite the king's protests, the princess joins the beggarman with the horse and her children. The group reaches a castle, but go behind it and enter a cave hidden by a large rock; the beggarman now transformed into a large ogre. After discovering the true nature of the beggarman, the princess takes her children and rides away on the horse . The ogre rushes behind them, but the horse advises the princess to throw behind her objects to create magical obstacles: a rose (that creates a wall of fire); a peck of salt (that becomes a mountain of glass); a comb (that creates a thorny forest of bronze) and a golden mirror (that creates a lake). On the other side of the lake, the ogre ties a large stone around his neck and begins his swim across the lake to reach the princess on the other side. The horse enters the lake and fights the ogre to the death, so intense their battle that the lake dries up. After the fight, the horse tells the princess to kill it, and throw its ribs towards the sun, its head towards the moon, and its legs to the \"four horizons of the sky\". The princess obeys its orders; the legs create four golden poplar trees with emerald leaves; the ribs change into a golden castle, with villages and meadows, and the head becomes a silver river. Sailing down the river is a golden boat, with her husband, the stableboy. \n\n### Passage 5\n\n United Kingdom.

A Gest of Robyn Hood is divided into eight fyttes (sections) that tell interleaving stories of Robin and his band.  Jess Bessinger Jr divided Gest into four tales based on the characters that feature in them, each with several episodes, although the beginning and end of a tale or episode does not always align with the fyttes.  Bessinger's divisions are as follows:. Robin Hood, Knight, and Abbot (Tale A: Fytte 1, 2, and 4). Robin Hood, Little John, Sheriff, and Knight (Tale B: Fytte 3, 5, and 6). Robin Hood, Knight, and King (Tale C: Fytte 7 and the first half of 8). Death of Robin Hood (Tale D: The second half of fytte 8)Quotes from the text have been given with modern spelling. First Fytte. Robin Hood, a good yeoman and courteous outlaw, has heard 3 masses this morning: one to honour God the Father; one to honour the Holy Ghost; and one to honour the Virgin Mary, for whom he has a deep devotion. He has fasted since midnight, and Little John, also a good yeoman, suggests he should eat soon. Robin declines to dine without a guest to pay for the feast. He sends his men to find one and reminds them to do no harm to farmers, yeomen or gentlemen, but to rob bishops, archbishops and the Sheriff of Nottingham should they encounter them. Little John, Much the Miller's son and William Scarlock leave to search for a guest.. They see a knight on horseback in a back street in Barnsdale. He looks forlorn, slouched over in his saddle, his face careworn and streaked with tears. Little John approaches the Sorrowful Knight, genuflects, and welcomes him to the forest, saying his Master Robin Hood is waiting dinner for him. The Knight remarks \"He is good yeoman ... /Of him I have heard much good.\": lines 103-104  The Knight leaves with the outlaws. When Robin Hood sees the Sorrowful Knight, he pushes back his hood, and genuflects to him. They all wash, and sit down to a fine feast. They enjoy plenty of bread and wine, along with deer sweatbreads, pheasants, swans, and other river birds. The Knight remarks that he had not had such a dinner for weeks, and should he pass through this way again, he would return the favour. Robin retorts that the Knight should pay before he leaves, as it is not proper for a yeoman to pay for a knight's feast. The Sorrowful Knight says he has only 10 shillings, and is embarrassed to offer such a small amount. Little John checks his baggage, and verifies the Sorrowful Knight is truthful.. Robin remarks on the Sorrowful Knight's threadbare clothing, and inquires about his situation. the Sorrowful Knight responds that his ancestors have been knights for 100 years but now he is disgraced, because his son and heir killed a knight of Lancaster. To redeem him, the Sorrowful Knight borrowed 400 pounds from the Rich Abbot of St Mary's, using his lands as collateral. The loan is now due, but he has only 10 shillings, so his lands will be seized by the Abbot. Robin asks if he had any friends. The Knight replies that he had plenty when he was rich, but none that he is poor. Robin then asks if he has anybody who could offer collateral. The Knight replied that he had none \"But if it be Our dear Lady;/She failed me never or this day.\": lines 259-60  Robin, who has a deep devotion to the Virgin Mary, declares that she is the best collateral in all of England. He instructs Little John to fetch 400 pounds from their treasure chest, and pay the Knight. Emboldened by Robin's words, Little John suggests new livery in Robin's colours of scarlet and green, and a new horse. Robin offers a grey courser with a new saddle; after all, he says, the Knight is the Virgin Mary's messenger. Much suggests a good palfrey, Scarlock suggests new boots, and Little John suggests shining spurs. Robin adds that a knight can not ride alone, and offers Little John as a companion.: lines 1-324  \"In a yeoman's stead he may thee stand,/If thou great need have.\": lines 323-24 Second Fytte. The scene switches to York, where the monks of St Mary's Abbey are sitting down to dinner. The Abbot, the Prior, the Chief Steward, the Sheriff of Yorkshire, and the county Justice are discussing the Knight whose debt of 400 pounds is due today. The Prior observes that if it was him, he would pay 100 pounds now and the rest later. The Abbot remarks that the Knight is suffering hunger and cold while serving England's cause overseas. The Prior admonishes the Abbot that, in that case, it would pitiful to take his land; but such a grievous wrong would not bother the Abbot's conscience at all. The Abbot snaps back at the Prior, telling him he's always getting in the way. The \"fat-headed\"[line 363] Chief Steward suggests that the Knight is either dead or hanged. The county Justice offers his opinion that the Knight will not come. They are all disappointed when the Knight appears at the gate.. The Knight genuflects and salutes them all \"great and small\": line 408 . Upset at the Knight's appearance in the Abbey hall, the Abbot skips the customary courtesies and demands if he brought the Abbot's money. Not one penny, the Knight calmly replies. The Abbot snaps back, then why are you here? The Knight answers that he is here to beg for more time. The county Justice sharply interrupts, your time is up and your land is forfeit. Still on one knee, the Knight begs the Justice to \"be my frende\": line 423 . The Justice responds that he can not; he is working on retainer from the Abbot. The Knight then looks to the Sheriff, who also refuses to aid the Knight. Finally the Knight offers his services as the Abbot's Knight until the debt is paid. The Abbot rebukes the Knight's offer. \"'Out,' he said, 'thou false knight,/Speed thee out of my hall!'\": lines 451-2  The Knight calls the Abbot a liar, and stands up. As the Knight approaches, the Justice asks the Abbot how much would he give the Knight to purchase the land outright. 100 pounds is the Abbot's reply; make it 200, insists the Justice. The Knight strides to the Abbot's table, and shakes Robin's 400 pounds out of the bag and onto the table. The Abbot is stunned. He tells the Justice to take the money as an additional retainer. The Justice refuses. The Knight then announces to everyone in the hall that he has paid his debt; his land is his once more. The Knight leaves, now carefree. He travels home with a light heart, singing. His worried wife meets him at the gate to Wyresdale. Be happy, my wife, says the Knight, and pray for Robin Hood; without his kindness, we would be beggars now.. Over the next year the Knight accumulates the 400 pounds to repay Robin Hood. He also purchases 100 bows, 100 bundles of arrows, 100 horses, and hires 100 men clothed in red and white clothing. On the day his debt is due, the Knight and his men head for Barnesdale. At Wentbridge, they pass a fair where a stranger has won the wrestling match. The yeoman is in danger of being killed by the crowd. Remembering how Robin treated him, he orders his company to surround the yeoman, shouting that no harm would befall him. He purchases a cask of wine and breaks it open so that all may drink. But the Knight and his company stay until the fair is done to ensure the yeoman's safety. In the meantime, Robin Hood is waiting under the tree in the greenwood.: lines 325-572 Third Fytte. It is now autumn.: line 704  Little John is still the Knight's Yeoman, and joins other young men in longbow target practice. Three times Little John shoots; three times he \"split the wand\": line 582 . The Sheriff of Nottingham is impressed. He approaches Little John, asking his name and birthplace. Little John replies, Reynold Greenleaf of Holderness. The Sheriff then asks Little John to work for him. Only if the Sheriff obtains a leave of absence from the Knight, Little John advises. The Knight agrees, and Little John rides off on one of the Sheriff's good strong horses. One day the Sheriff goes hunting and leaves Little John behind. It is now past noon, and Little John has not eaten. Little John asks the steward for dinner, but is told not until the Sheriff comes home. Little John then threatens the butler, and gives him a strong blow to his back. The butler runs to the pantry and shuts the door. Little John kicks the door open and drinks more than his share of the ale and wine.. The Sheriff's Cook, a bold stout man, confronts Little John. The Cook delivers three strong blows to Little John, who vows that he won't leave until he pays the Cook back. They both draw swords and fight for an hour, with neither gaining the advantage. Little John acknowledges that the Cook is the best swordsman he has ever seen; if he is as good with the bow, the Cook could join with Robin Hood. The Cook agrees. Little John and the Cook sit down to a fine dinner. Then they break the lock on the Sheriff's treasury and steal all the silver dinnerware plus 300 pounds in coin. They leave immediately to meet Robin Hood.. After they greet each other, Robin Hood inquires as who is \"that fair yeoman\": line 709  accompanying Little John, and what is the news from Nottingham. Little John responds that the proud Sheriff sends his greetings, his Cook, his silver tableware, and 300 pounds in coin. Robin replies sarcastically that it wasn't because of the Sheriff's generosity. Little John has a sudden thought to trick the Sheriff. He runs 5 miles to meet the Sheriff, hunting with his hounds. Where have you been, demands the Sheriff. In this forest, replies Little John, I have seen a green hart, with a herd of 140 deer. The Sheriff exclaims, that would be a sight to see! Then quickly follow me, says Little John. When they meet Robin and his 140 men, Little John announces that here is the master hart and his herd of deer! The Sheriff is amazed by how Little John has betrayed him. It's your fault, says Little John, I never got my dinner at your place.. The Sheriff sits down to dinner, and is horrified when he realizes he is eating from his own silver tableware. Robin says, consider it charity, and for Little John's sake, I grant you your life. When dinner was done, Robin tells Little John to strip the Sheriff of his fur-lined mantle and all his fine clothes, and wrap him in a green mantle. Robin then orders the Sheriff's men to do likewise, and lie down next to the Sheriff. All night they lie on the cold ground in only their breeches, shirts, and the green mantles. The next morning, the  Sheriff complains about his stiff muscles. Don't complain, replies Robin, this is how we live; he continues, for the next year, I will teach you how to live as an outlaw. The Sheriff grumbles, not for all the gold in England. He pleads with Robin to let him go. Robin demands that he swear an oath on Robin's sword that he will never again harm Robin or any of his men. The Sheriff swears his oath, and leaves the greenwood.: lines 573-816 Fourth Fytte. It is now one year later. The scene is Robin Hood and Little John in the greenwood. Little John suggests that it is time for dinner, but Robin declines. He fears the Virgin Mary is angry with him, since the Knight has not yet arrived. Little John consoles him, saying that the sun has not yet set, and the Knight is true to his word. Robin instructs Little John to take Much and William Scarlok, and search for an \"unknown guest\"[line ??]. Irritated, Little John takes up his bow and his sword to do Robin's bidding. On the highway in Barnesdale they spot a monk on a good palfrey. Little John remarks to Much, here is our pay. The monk is being escorted by 52 men and seven pack horses. Little John tells his companions to prepare for an ambush. He aims his arrow at the monk, ordering him to stop where he is. Calling him a churlish monk, Little John accuses the Monk of angering his master, Robin Hood. \"\"He is a strong thief,\" said the monk,/\"Of him heard I never good.\"\": lines 883-4 . Much lets fly an arrow which barely misses the Monk's chest, and he quickly dismounts. All the attendants turn and flee, leaving only a little page and a groom with the pack horses.. Little John brings the Monk to the huntsman's hut. Robin Hood lowers his hood, but the uncourteous Monk does not. Robin asks Little John how many men the monk had. 52 men, is his answer. Blow the horn, orders Robin. 140 men, dressed in striped scarlet, answer the call to run down the Monk's attendants. Robin & Little John force the Monk to wash up for dinner, and they serve him at the table. While he is eating, Robin asks the Monk, to which abbey do you belong & what office do you hold. I am the Chief Steward of St Mary's Abbey, answers the Monk.. Robin Hood is still worried that the Virgin Mary is angry with him, since the Knight has not yet appeared. Little John tells Robin not to worry, the Monk has brought the money; he is from her abbey. . Robin is not consoled. She was my collateral for a loan I made to the Knight, he says. Speaking to the Monk, Robin asks to see the silver - if he brought it. The Monk swears at Robin, saying he knows nothing of this loan. Robin Hood retorts: God is righteous, and so is the Virgin Mary, you are to blame; you are her servant, and her messenger. How much money do you carry, Robin Hood demands of the Monk. 20 marks of silver, he replies. Robin orders Little John to check the Monk's baggage.. After laying out the contents of the Monk's purse, Little John hurries back to Robin Hood. The Virgin Mary has doubled your money, he declares. Robin is elated. They all drink to her honour. Curious at what is in the packhorses, Robin again asks Little John to search again. The Monk protests strenuously, mounts his horse, and rides off.: lines 817-1040 . It is still daylight when the Knight rides into Barnesdale, and sees Robin Hood standing under the greenwood tree. The Knight dismounts, lowers his hood, and genuflects to Robin. Robin warmly welcomes him, and asks why he is so late. The Knight replies that he stopped to help a poor yeoman in trouble. In that case, rejoins Robin, for helping a good yeoman, I am your friend. The Knight offers the 400 pounds, and 20 marks more for Robin's courtesy. He refuses, saying the money was already delivered by the Monk of St Mary's. But the bows and arrows I brought are a poor payment, says the Knight. Robin sends Little John to retrieve 400 pounds of the Monk's money, and then hands it to the Knight. Buy a horse and a good harness, he says, get some new clothing. And he adds, if ever you need spending money, come see me.: lines 1041-1120 Fifth Fytte. The Sheriff of Nottingham announces an archery contest for all the best archers of the North. The prize will be an arrow with a head and feathers of red gold, and a shaft of white silver. Upon hearing of the contest, Robin Hood calls his fellowship together. He orders that only six of his men shoot with him; the rest, with arrows nocked, are to keep watch on the Sheriff's men.. Three times Robin shoots, and three times he splits the wand. But so did good Gilberte with the White Hand. The two shoot again, but Robin is best, and wins the prize. The outlaws begin their return to the greenwood, but the fair-goers shout and blow horns. The Sheriff's men loose a hail of arrows, and Robin shouts curses at the Sheriff for breaking his pledge. Many of the fellowship are wounded, including Little John, who took an arrow to his knee. Little John begs Robin not to let the Sheriff take him alive - he tells Robin to inflict mortal wounds to his head. Robin replies, not for all the gold in England! God forbid that you should die, cries Much, and hefts Little John onto his back.. Not far away is the castle of Sir Richard at the Lee, the Sorrowful Knight. Immediately Sir Richard takes in Robin and his men. He orders the gates be shut, the bridge be drawn up, and the walls manned.: lines 1121-1264 Sixth Fytte. The High Sheriff of Nottingham raises a large army from around the countryside to besiege Sir Richard's castle. Traitorous Knight, the proud Sheriff shouts to Sir Richard, you harbor the King's enemy against the law. The Knight courteously agrees that he is doing so. Sir Richard adds, tell our King what has happened, and see what he says. The Sheriff rides to London, and tells the King that Sir Richard is supporting the outlaw band. Furthermore, he tells the King, Sir Richard is using the outlaws to set himself up as lord of the north land. The King said he would be in Nottingham in two weeks, and that the Sheriff is to gather more archers from all over the countryside. In the meantime, Robin Hood returns to the greenwood, where Little John later joins him after his knee heals.. Having missed his chance to capture Robin, the Sheriff lies in wait to capture Sir Richard instead. He finally overcomes the gentle Knight as he is hawking by the river, and takes him to Nottingham. When Sir Richard's wife is told what has happened, she rides out to the greenwood to find Robin. For Our dear Lady's sake, she implores Robin, don't let my husband be killed for supporting you. Who took your lord, asks Robin. The Sheriff, she replies, and they are not more than three miles from here. Robin quickly gathers his men and they run towards Nottingham.. The fellowship catches up with the Sheriff. Robin stops the Sheriff, asking about the news from the King. Robin then quickly draws his bow, and lets loose an arrow that knocks the Sheriff off his horse. Before the Sheriff can rise, Robin beheads him with his sword. Lie there, proud Sheriff, taunts Robin, no man could trust you while you were alive.: lines 1265-1412 The rest of the fellowship attack the Sheriff's men and cut them down. Robin leaps to Sir Richard's side, cuts his bonds, and hands him a bow. Come to the greenwood with me, Robin orders, until I can get us \"... grace/Of Edward, our comely king.\": lines 1411-12 Seventh Fytte. The King arrives at Nottingham and asks about Robin Hood and Sir Richard. Hearing what has happened, he seizes the Knight's lands, and searches for Robin throughout Lancashire. Reaching Plompton Park, he notices that there are far fewer deer than usual. Cursing Robin Hood, the King orders Robin to be brought before him, and that anyone who brings him the head of Sir Richard would receive his lands. Then an old knight advises, as long as Robin Hood lives, no man will hold Sir Richard's lands. Six months later, one of the King's royal foresters approaches the King, suggesting a subterfuge to catch Robin. You and five men should dress as monks, he said, and I will lead you into the forest; then you will meet Robin Hood. The King wears a broad abbot's hat to conceal his face, and goes into the forest. They soon meet Robin, standing in the road along with many of his men. Robin Hood grabs the reins of the King's horse. Sir Abbot, Robin addresses the disguised King, we are but poor yeomen of the forest who live by the King's deer, share with us some of your wealth as an act of charity. The disguised King replies he has only 40 pounds, having spent much during the last two weeks entertaining the King and his lords. If I had 100 pounds, he continues, I would give you half. Robin takes the 40 pounds, counts out 20 pounds, and returns 20 pounds to the disguised King. Our great king bids you come to Nottingham, says the disguised King, and shows Robin the royal seal. Robin immediately genuflects as he says,. \t\"I love no man in all the world/. \tSo well as I do my king;/. \tWelcome is my lord's seal;\": lines 1541-43 . In honour of the King, Robin invites the disguised King to dinner. Robin blows his horn to assemble the fellowship, who genuflect around him. The disguised King is surprised, realizing that Robin's men are more willing to answer his call than the royal men are to answer the King's call. Quickly the feast is prepared, with Robin and Little John waiting on the disguised King themselves. The disguised King is treated to fat venison, white bread, red wine, and ale.. After dinner, Robin arranges an archery demonstration. The disguised King remarks that the targets were too far away. Robin orders, anyone who misses the target would forfeit his arrows and endure a slap on his face from me. Twice Robin shoots, and twice he splits the wand. On the third attempt, Robin misses, and his men taunt him. Robin approaches the disguised King, offers his arrows, and says he is ready for his slap. The disguised King declines, saying it is against the rules of his order. Do it, declares Robin. The disguised King rolls up his sleeve and deals a resounding slap that knocks Robin to the ground. The disguised King bends over to help Robin up, and as he does so, Robin looks intently into the King's face. Noticing Robin's reaction, Sir Richard does the same. Then both of them genuflect to their King. Robin asks mercy for his men, which the King grants. The King then invites Robin to join Edward's royal court. Only if I can bring my men with me, replies Robin.: lines 1413-1668 Eighth Fytte. In the first section, the King asks if Robin has any green cloth so he and his men can exchange their black cowls for ones of Lincoln green. Back to Nottingham, the King commands. With feasting, drinking, and singing, the King welcomes Robin and his men into his service, and restores Sir Richard's lands.. Robin and his men spend the next year in the royal court. Robin has spent all his wealth, as well as the money meant for his men. Now only Little John and Scathelock remain. One day, while watching some young men at target practice, he becomes homesick. Robin asks the King for leave to make a pilgrimage to his chapel of Mary Magdalene in Barnsdale. The King grants him seven days.. When he reaches the greenwood with the birds merrily singing. He shoots a hart, and blows his horn. All the outlaws in the forest recognize Robin's horn and come running. They push back their hoods and genuflect, welcoming Robin back. There he remains for twenty-two years.: lines 1669-1800 Years later, Robin has a kinswoman who was Prioress of Kirkley.  She and her lover, Sir Roger of Doncaster, are plotting to kill Robin. Since the Prioress is skilled in the art of blood-letting, she lets Robin slowly bleed to death when he comes to Kirkley for treatment.: lines 1801-24  The tale ends with a prayer: \"Christ have mercy on his soul,/.../For he was a good outlaw,/And did poor men much good.\": lines 1821, 1823-4 Geography. The place names mentioned in Gest locate Robin Hood in the West Riding of Yorkshire: Blyth; Doncaster; St Mary Magdalene Church at Campsall; and Kirklees Abbey. The cities of York, Lancaster, and Nottingham, as well as the Knight's castle at Wyresdale, are also mentioned.  This area is famous for its wide river valleys, and the eastern foothills of the South Pennines, with its numerous limestone caves where outlaws could hide.  The greenwood of Barnsdale Forest is Robin's home; \"Robyn stood in Barnesdale/And leaned him to a tree,\": lines 9-10  is how the tale of the Sorrowful Knight opens. Earliest texts. A Gest of Robin Hode is considered as one of the three oldest Robin Hood tales. The other two are Robin Hood and the Monk (Child 119) and Robin Hood and the Potter (Child 121). Both of these latter tales survive as manuscripts dated to the second half of the 15th century; however, there are no surviving manuscripts of Gest. The earliest text fragments for Gest are from about a dozen printed editions dated to the 16th and 17th centuries.: ??  To identify the most important editions, Child labeled them as a through  g. Texts a through e are referred to as the early texts, and texts f and g are called the later texts. Of interest to linguists and historians is that the later texts replaced some of the obsolete words of the early texts in order to make Gest more understandable to the audiences of the time.: 40 : 39   Since Child's time, more editions have been identified by researchers.. John Maddicott has remarked on the lack of variation between the two earliest texts: text a and text b. He interpreted this lack of variation to a standard work being available prior to the printed editions. text a. also known as the Antwerp edition. Entitled A Gest of Robyn Hode; it has no printer's name, location, or date.Also known as the Lettersnijder edition, it is attributed to Jan van Doesbroch in Antwerp c. 1510. Although it contains only about 200 of the total 456 quatrains, it is considered the most authentic version of the text, due to the linguistic archaisms in the text. It is housed at the National Library of Scotland.Text a is part of an eleven-text volume known as the Chapman and Myllar prints. However, only nine texts in the volume were actually printed by Chapman and Myllar. Text a was one of the two texts which were not. According to the National Library of Scotland, the volume was presented to the Advocates Library sometime before August 1788 by John Alston of Glasgow. The binding was not sturdy, being made of parchment, which explains why so many pages of text a are lost. (Text a being the last work in the volume.) Sometime between 1798 and 1808 the volume was rebound in London by Charles Hering.The page illustration shown at the top of this article shows the first page of text a. The  woodcut is almost identical to the Yeoman woodcut in Richard Pynson's edition of The Canterbury Tales. However, the typesetter did not leave enough room for the woodcut, and had to reset the first 1-1/2 pages. The typesetter resorted to using abbreviations and run-on sentences to make everything fit.: 57 text b. also known as the de Worde edition, c. 1493-1518. Entitled A Lytell Geste of Robyn Hode; it was printed by Wynken de Worde in London.This edition is nearly complete, and may be older than text a. It was used as the base text by Ritson and Gutch. Modern scholars, such as Child, Dobson and Taylor, Knight, and Ohlgren consider it to contain more errors, so they use text a and filled in from text b. It is housed at Cambridge University Library.The edition's date is determined from the type fonts used, and the printer's device on the last page.: 89 texts c through e (Douce Fragments). Individual pages which are in poor condition. They are housed at the Bodleian Library. text f (Copeland edition). Entitled A Mery Geste of Robyn Hoode. it was printed in London by William Copeland no earlier than 1548. It is housed at the British Museum. text g (White edition). Entitled A Merry Gest of Robin Hood. it was printed in London for Edward White, and is undated. It is housed at the Bodleian Library. Pynson's edition (c. 1495–1500). Entitled A Lytell Geste. This edition survives as three sets of fragments:: 45 . text c (Douce Fragment). single leaf fragment, now housed at Cambridge University Library. two leaves now housed at the Folger Shakespeare Library Hugo Goes edition. Entitled A Lytell Geste and printed in York sometime prior to 1509. The only surviving leaf is one of the Douce Fragments (e.12). Hugo Goes worked with one of de Worde's assistants, Henry Watson.  When de Worde moved his business to Fleet Street after 1500, Goes acquired some of his fonts before moving to York to start his own business.: 157-8 Julian Notary edition (c. 1515). Entitled A Lytell Geste. The surviving fragments are four imperfect leaves attached to paper binding strips (Douce fragment f.1).  The attribution to Notary is confirmed by the size and style of the type fonts; he was the only London printer to use 92 mm.: 149-50 Copeland edition (c. 1565). A single leaf fragment of waste print used as spine support for a volume printed in London by John Wolfe in 1584.. It is attributed to Copeland based upon the type font. The date is estimated from the language differences from his 1560 edition.: 239-40  It is housed at the Codrington Library, All Souls College, Oxford. White edition (copy of the Bodleian Library edition). Entitled A Merry Iest of Robin Hood, and printed in London for Edward White, bookseller, c. 1594. The printer is thought to have been Edward Allde. Anthony Munday, author of the Robin Hood plays, was apprenticed to Allde. The text is closely based upon William Copeland's edition, however, the spelling was updated and punctuation was introduced.: 245–7  It is housed at the Chaplin Library, Williams College, Williamstown, Massachusetts. Literary analysis. Gest was studied by William Hall Clawson in 1909. Clawson was a student of F. J. Child's successor, George Lyman Kittredge, and his dissertation on Gest expanded on Child's introduction.  In 1968, medievalist D. C. Fowler published A Literary History of the Popular Ballad. Fowler was one of the first to advocate the study of the English and Scottish ballads relative to their historical time and place, rather than simply within the classification of the Child anthology.: 3,4  In 1974, J. B. Bessinger Jr attempted to extend Clawson and incorporate Fowler's proposal that Gest was a product of 15th-century minstrels.: 43  One of Bessinger's contributions was a narrative schematic that refined Child's \"3-ply web\" into three tales of nine episodes distributed among eight fyttes.In 1984, Douglas Gray, the first J. R. R. Tolkien Professor of English Literature and Language at the University of Oxford, considered the Robin Hood and Scottish Border ballads more as oral poems. He objected to the then-current definitions of a ballad as some ideal form, whose characteristics were distilled from the Child Ballads. When compared to \"this notion of a 'pure ballad', the Robin Hood poems seem messy and anormalous\", he contended.: 9  Therefore, he titled his article The Robin Hood Poems, and not The Robin Hood Ballads.. However, Gray admitted that the Robin Hood tales, like most popular literature, are sometimes regarded as \"sub-literary material\", containing formulaic language and a \"thin texture\", especially \"when they are read on the printed page\".: 4  Additionally, he argued, that since Child had grouped all the Robin Hood 'ballads' together, some literary studies had \"rashly based themselves on all the Robin Hood ballads in the collection\": 9 , instead of discarding those of dubious value. J. R. Maddicott also recognized this issue, and argued that since so little is known about the origins of the ballads from the available early manuscripts and printed texts, internal evidence has to be used.) Gray further contended that, as oral poetry, each poem should be judged as a performance. He agreed with Ruth Finnegan in considering the performance as \"integral to the identity of the poem as actually realized\".: 10  In an oral performance, a skillful raconteur can draw his audience in, making them part of his performance; hence no two oral performances are identical.: 10  Gray points out that one of the characteristics of Gest are scenes with rapid dialogue or conversations, in which the formulaic diction, limited vocabulary, and stereotyped expressions are artfully used to express emotion.: 25  Such scenes lying dully on a page can spring into action when recited by one or two talented minstrels. The Gest poet. Gest is a compilation of many early Robin Hood tales, either in verse or prose, but most of them now lost.: 25 : 431 : ??  They were woven together into a single narrative poem by an unknown poet.  F. C. Child, arguing that there was only one poet, described the Gest poet as \"a thoroughly congenial spirit.\": 49  W. H. Clawson considered him \"to have been exceedingly skillful\",: 24  while J. B. Bessinger declared him as \"original and transitional\"[p 43]. Gray thought the weaving to have \"been neatly done\".: 23  J. C. Holt implied that there were two poets: the original poet who compiled the First, Second, and Fourth Fyttes as a single poem; and another less skilled poet who compiled the Third and Fifth Fyttes into the work produced by the original poet.: 22-25  Others, such as J. R. Maddicott,, have considered him as less than adequate. They point to a narrative that is not sequential (it jumps back and forth between the tales); the transitions between tales are not smooth; there are inconsistencies within each tale, and between the tales.  Child was one of the first to recognize that Gest contains ballads from two different traditions: the Barnsdale tradition (found in the First, Second, and Fourth Fyttes), and the Nottingham tradition (found in the Third, Fifth, and Sixth Fyttes).: 51  Clawson then attempted to identify the source ballads.: 125-7  J. C. Holt considers Clawson work as fundamental to a careful study of Gest, and admits there is no consensus on how many underlying tales were used, or which lines can be considered the work of the Gest poet. In contrast to Clawson, who struggled mightily to connect Gest with existing outlaw ballads, Holt's study indicated that none of the sources have survived, that the tales were not necessarily in verse form, and that the source tales come from several traditions.: 36  Why the Gest poet used these particular tales to construct this epic-length poem is unknown. First Fytte. The First Fytte begins with a now-lost light-hearted tale about Robin Hood and a poor knight.: lines 65–244 : 24, 125  The original tale was obviously part of a Barnsdale tradition of Robin Hood, based upon the numerous references to local landmarks. When the Knight is accosted in Barnsdale, he mentions that he planned to spend the night in either Blyth or Doncaster.: line 108 The remainder of the First Fytte: lines 245–324 : 125  is based on a 'Miracle of the Virgin Mary' story. The 'Miracle' was a moral story often told during religious services, and these stories were very popular. They generally concerned the Virgin Mary (or any of the Saints) being invoked as surety for a loan. The most common ending of a Miracle described an actual miracle to repay the loan. There was also a humorous ending where the repayment money is taken from a person in a religious order who in some way represented the Virgin or Saint. In this ending, this person is regarded as the messenger sent by the Virgin or Saint to repay the debt.: 25–38  The First Fytte ends with Robin Hood and his men outfitting the poor knight in a manner befitting a messenger of the Virgin Mary.: lines 303–4 . Second Fytte. This Fytte has a darker tone. The first part of the Second Fytte appears to be based on another now-lost tale, where a knight repays his debt to an Abbot with money received from Robin Hood. Parts of the original tale remain, even though they do not fit with the end of the First Fytte. In the original tale, the Knight is away on an overseas military campaign,: lines 353–6  but unexpectedly re-appears.: lines 383–4  He orders his men to put on their ragged travelling clothes before approaching the abbey.: lines 385–8  His men and the horses are led to the stables, as the Knight, also in ragged clothes, enters the great hall.: lines 390–404   Little John is never mentioned, nor is the Abbey named. Near the end of the Fytte, the Knight resumes his good clothing, leaving his ragged clothes at the abbey.: lines 499–500 : 42–5 . The rest of this Fytte appears to be fragments of other tales, perhaps compiled by the Gest poet. The light-hearted fragment describing how the Knight prepares to repay Robin Hood: lines 501–536  has an internal consistency, and is reminiscent of the opening lines of the First Fytte. The fair at Wentbridge: lines 537–568  may have been taken from another tale: 47  to be used as a plot device to delay the Knight, thus preparing for the tale of Robin Hood and the Monk in the Fourth Fytte.. Third Fytte. This episode probably consists of three or four now-lost tales. The light-hearted opening scene at the archery shoot: lines 577–600  could have been borrowed from any of the then-popular tales. After which the Gest poet inserted two quatrains which refer to Little John's courteous master from whom the Sheriff must secure permission.: lines 601–608  The second now-lost tale: lines 613–760  is definitely low comedy. The audience is told that Little John is seeking vengeance on the Sheriff for some unspecified action.: lines 613–616  When Little John is denied breakfast because he slept in, the subsequent action of \"exuberant rough-house\" \"turns into a scene of total destruction\",: 28  as Little John picks a fight with the butler. The tale then assumes \"an air of carnival 'justice'\",: 28  when he breaks into the pantry to eat and drink his fill.. However, the third tale: lines 761–796  has a somber tone, as Little John lures the Sheriff into an ambush. Instead of killing them all, Robin makes the Sheriff and his men endure a night on the cold wet ground, wearing nothing but a green mantle.. The last few lines of the Fytte: lines 797–816  were probably written by the Gest poet. The Sheriff's complains that he would rather have Robin \"smite off mine head\": line 799  than spend another night in the greenwood. Robin then demands the Sheriff swear an oath on Robin's sword not to harm Robin or his men.: lines 805–806, 813  This little scene is a foreshadow of the scene in the Sixth Fytte, where Robin Hood uses his sword to decapitate the Sheriff as punishment for breaking his oath.: lines 1389–1396 . Fourth Fytte. The Second Fytte ended with the Knight being delayed at the fair at Wentbridge. The Fourth Fytte opens with Robin Hood worrying about the Knight's late arrival.: lines 821–828  It's not about the money; he is fretting about why the Virgin Mary is upset with him. This is the Gest poet's introduction to yet another now-lost tale about Robin and the Monk.: lines 829–1040  This tale is also the ending of the Miracle story, as Little John recognizes that the Monk carries the debt repayment which was ensured by the Virgin Mary.At the beginning of the Monk tale, there is another inconsistency. When first spotted by Little John, there were two monks.: line 851  Later, at the feast, there is only one monk mentioned.: lines 897–1040 . The last part of the Fytte: lines 1041–1120  is the ending of Tale A. This reunion and reconciliation of Robin and the Knight was most probably original material written by the Gest poet.. Fifth Fytte. The original now-lost tale probably consisted of the archery match, the subsequent attack by the Sheriff's men, the wounding of Little John, and the flight into the greenwood.(lines ) No parallels have been found among the extant contemporary tales. The remainder of the Fytte was composed by the Gest poet.: 80–3 . Sixth Fytte. The original now-lost tale probably consisted of the sheriff capturing a gentle knight, taking him to Nottingham, the knight's wife begging Robin to save her husband, the subsequent skirmish, and the rescued knight becoming a fugitive in Robin's group.: lines 1321–1408  Once again, there are no parallels to be found among the extant contemporary tales. The remainder of the Fytte was composed by the Gest poet.: 84-91 . Seventh Fytte. Separately from the Robin Hood ballads, Child discussed the \"King and Subject\" ballad tradition, in which the King (in disguise) meets with one of his Subjects.[Child, V, pt 1] He mentions in passing that the Seventh and Eighth Fyttes of Gest contains such a tale.[p. 69] Both Child and Clawson dismiss The King's Disguise, and Friendship with Robin Hood (Child 151), (the only extant Robin Hood ballad involving the king) as being an 18th century paraphrase of Gest. Curiously, both also discuss two tales, King Edward and the Shepherd[Rochester] and The King and the Hermit,[Rochester] as being very similar to the original ballad underlying the Seventh Fytte, but never make the connection.: 106–7, 127  Clawson simply remarks that \"tales like this are common and popular the world over\".: 103  However, Thomas Ohlgren considers the parallels between the two tales as part of the evidence supporting his assertion that \"our comely king\" in Gest was Edward III.: 9–12  (See Historical Analysis). Eighth Fytte. Both Child and Clawson are silent on possible sources for this fytte. Character descriptions. Most of the main characters are described in 52 lines at the beginning of the poem.: lines 1–20, 29–60  Thus the Gest poet immediately draws attention to the purpose of his work. Gest's scenes are constructed to show the difference in the behavior of good and wicked characters. Goodness (referred to as \"Courtesy\") is displayed as ethical or moral qualities, such as kindness, generosity, truthfulness, and personal loyalty. \"Courtesy\" (the word occurs 17 times in Gest) is the opposite of injustice.: 30 . Robin Hood. good yeomanSee Historical Analysis section for a fuller description of yeoman as used in Gest.. proud outlawThis is the only time 'proud' is applied to Robin Hood; but it is applied to the Sheriff of Nottingham 20 times throughout the Gest. The word is being used in two different senses. When applied to the Sheriff, proud means 'haughty, arrogant'. When applied to Robin, proud means 'brave, bold, valiant', or 'noble in bearing or appearance'.. courteous outlawIn Middle English, courtesy meant 'refined, well-mannered, polite' and 'gracious, benevolent, generous, merciful'. Robin repeatedly exhibits all these traits.. devoutRobin hears three masses a day, and has a special devotion to the Virgin Mary. The latter is a strong motivator for him in Tale A.. leadershipRobin is able to impose a code of conduct upon his fellow outlaws. He insists that they can do \"well enough\": line 50  by not waylaying farmers, yeomen, or any knight or squire who is a \"good fellow\".: line 55  He singles out bishops and archbishops for beatings. Robin has a particularly strong hostility for the Sheriff of Nottingham.. Little John. He defers to Robin by calling him \"Master\",: lines 19, 41  and serves as Robin's right-hand man. But he is not reluctant in letting Robin know how he feels about following his orders. He agrees to follow Robin's code of conduct for the fellowship, but shows his concern (or irritation) when Robin insists on finding a stranger for dinner so late in the day.. Much, the miller's son. Apparently of short stature, Much is praised as every \"inch of his body ... worth a man\".: lines 15–16  Much saves a wounded Little John by carrying him on his back.The remaining characters are described when they appear in the tale. Each character is described by one or more of their ethical or moral qualities. There are only three characters who are given a physical description. The Sorrowful Knight. The Gest poet spends eight lines describing his physical appearance.: lines 85–92  Little John, a good judge of people, calls him \"gentle\", \"courteous\", and \"noble\".: lines 95, 98  These qualities the Knight demonstrates repeatedly in Tales A and B.. The Greedy Abbot and the Kind-hearted Prior. The qualities of these two characters are revealed during their conversation at dinner, while awaiting the arrival of the Knight.: lines 341–362  The Abbot compounds his wickedness with a lie by calling the Knight \"false\".: line 455 . The Chief Steward. He is introduced as \"a fat-headed monk\",: lines 363–4  emphasizing the fat cheeks and neck under his monk's tonsure. Little John calls him \"a churl monk\";: line 873  insulting the monk twice with a single word. In Middle English it meant a person lacking in courtesy, or a person of low birth.. Sheriff of Nottingham. He is the stereotypical wicked villain with no redeeming qualities. He lies when he tells the King that the Knight is a traitor,: lines 1293–1296  but later becomes a traitor himself by breaking his oath to Robin.: lines 1391–1396 . King Edward Linguistic analysis. Francis James Child was the first to look at Gest from a linguistic perspective. While compiling The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, he was in frequent contact with language scholars in England who were collecting quotations from Middle English texts for what would become the first volumes of the Oxford English Dictionary. These scholars, including Walter William Skeat, the leading philologist in England, would later publish A Concise Dictionary of Middle English, and An Etymological Dictionary of the English Language. It was Skeat who provided Child with transcriptions of the texts that appeared in Child's anthology. Skeat also was one of the first philologists to discuss English language dialects in English Dialects from the Eighth Century to the Present Day published in 1911.In his introduction to Gest, Child tried to argue that the references to Robin Hood in Piers Plowman and the Scottish chronicles indicated a date of composition for Gest as early as 1400, or even earlier. However, he was forced to conclude that \"There are no firm grounds on which to base an opinion.\": 40  Child asserted that there were \"A considerable number of Middle-English forms\" present; he even constructed a partial listing of the words ending in '-e'. William Hall Clawson, a doctoral student under Child's successor, George Lyman Kittredge, expanded Child's word list, and even calculated the final totals of how many times such words were used in each Fytte. Thus Clawson attempted to \"prove clearly that it [Gest] extends back to a period ... antedating the year 1400.\": 4–6 A modern linguistic analysis of Gest was performed by Masa Ikegami in 1985. He constructed multiple lines of linguistic evidence that Gest was written in a Northern or East Midlands dialect, most probably during the mid- to late-15th century. His evidence is based upon Gest's quatrain structure, its ABCB or ABAB rhyme scheme, and its meter (rhythm pattern). The Gest meter can be summarized as: the first and third lines have four metrically stressed syllables. the second and fourth lines have three metrically stressed syllables. each stressed syllable is preceded by one or two unstressed syllablesThis meter is illustrated in the following quatrain, which should be read aloud in order to hear the rhythm of the stressed syllables (in bold font): Irregular lines do occur, but they are limited, and only occur in the three-beat lines.: 272–3 Evidence of date of composition. Presence of silent final '-e'. Modern linguists no longer accept the presence of final '-e' (now known as schwa) as evidence for composition prior to 1400. Ikegami provides a summary of other works known to have been composed in the 15th which contain the silent final '-e'.: 271 The silent final '-e' does not have to be pronounced in Gest in order to support the meter (rhythm pattern). Ikegami uses the example of 'grene wode', which Modern English speakers pronounce as two syllables: 'green wood'. In Chaucer's time, the phrase would have been pronounced as four syllables: 'gre-ne wo-de', where the schwa was pronounced as the 'a' in sofa or the 'u' in lucky. The phrase 'grene wode' occurs thirteen times in Gest, and the silent final '-e' never needs to be pronounced in order to \"keep the beat\".: 271–2 Presence of new phraseology. As a replacement for the now-silent '-e', Ikegami points out that the Gest poet introduces a new phrase construct: adjective + adjective|noun + noun. Some examples (with the stressed syllables in bold font and in modern spelling) are: Ikegami remarks that no works prior to 1400 have this phrasing.: 273-4  Rather, Gest's use of this phrasing is similar to that of The Floure and the Leafe, which is considered to have composed during the third quarter of the 15th century (c. 1450–1475).: 279 Frequent use of 'long e' rhyme. The Gest poet uses several rhymes that only work if the modern 'long e' sound is used. Some examples, with only the rhyming words shown, follow: The modern 'long e' sound is considered to be one of the earliest changes associated with the Great Vowel Shift which began c. 1400.: 275-6 Rhyming 'all' with 'tale'. This rhyme: lines 1422, 1424  only works after c. 1400. It is also associated with the great vowel shift.: 275 Evidence of Northern or East Midland dialect. The linguistic research begun by Skeat and his colleagues (as published in their various Middle English dictionaries) has been continued by modern linguists. Between 1898 and 1905, Joseph Wright published the seminal English Dialect Dictionary, based upon data collected by the English Dialect Society. The famous Survey of English Dialects was undertaken between 1950 and 1961. Therefore, linguists have as detailed an understanding of the various Middle English dialects as the surviving literature and native speakers allow. . The evidence for a Northern or East Midland dialect within the very words of Gest relies on the observation that, prior to standardization of English language spelling, Middle English authors spelled words as they were pronounced (that is, phonetically). Thus the rhyme words in each quatrain are also very valuable in determining whether or not regional dialects can be identified in Gest.  Some of Ikegami's findings are below.: 276-8 . Northern pronunciation. The Northern England dialect of Middle English (ME) results from a mixture of the Anglian dialects of Old English (OE) and the Old Norse (ON) of the Danelaw, with an overlay of Norman French.. The OE/ON vowel ā (long a) appears as ME /a:/ (pronounced roughly like the 'a' in father) in the rhyme pair hame:dame: lines 594,596 . The non-Northern vowel /ɔ:/ (pronounced roughly like 'aw' in law) appears in the rhyme pair more:before: lines 986,988 .. The OE/ON diphthong āg (equivalent to 'w') appears as ME /au/ (pronounced roughly like the 'ou' in house) in the rhyme pair lowe:shawe: lines 1134,1136 . The non-Northern ME diphthong /ɔu/ (pronounced roughly like the 'o' in bone) appears in the rhyme pair lowe:inowe: lines 170,172 .Northern and Eastern Midlands pronunciation. The Eastern Midlands dialect of ME results from a mixture of the OE Mercian dialect and the ON of the Danelaw, with an overlay of Norman French.. There are two sequences of long vowel pronunciation changes which are characteristic of Northern and Eastern Midland dialects. The OE long vowel ǣ (pronounced roughly like the 'a' in mat) was raised to the ME long open vowel /ɛ:/ (pronounced roughly like the 'a' in hay), and raised again to ME close /e/ (pronounced roughly like the 'e' in bet). Similarly, the OE long vowel ā was also raised to ME long open vowel /ɛ:/, and then raised again to ME close /o:/ (pronounced roughly like the 'oa' in boat). These changes appear in the rhyme pairs: see:the: lines 222,224 ; mone:none: lines 254,256 ; do:theretoo: lines 686,688 ; ere:chere: lines 954,956 .. Additional vowel pronunciations which are typical of the North and the East Midlands include OE short y appearing as /i/, pronounced roughly like the 'i' in bit (rhyme pair synne:in: lines 38,40 ; and OE or ON long ȳ appearing as /i:/, pronounced roughly like the 'ee' in see (rhyme pair pryde:beside: lines 86,88 . Historical analysis. Maurice Keen wrote The Outlaws of Medieval Legend in 1961, which compared the historical background of the Robin Hood ballads with other legendary and historical outlaw figures. Over the next four decades, various historians contributed to the debate on which historical periods are depicted in the Robin Hood ballads.  In 1968, D C Fowler published A Literary History of the Popular Ballad as a modern update to Child's Ballads. He focused on the historical background of Gest and the earliest Robin Hood tales. Many of the Child Robin Hood ballads were composed later, some as late as the 17th century, and are not relevant to explorations of the 14th–16th century versions of the Robin Hood legend.. The linguistic analysis suggests that Gest was probably compiled c. 1450–1475. The literary analysis suggests that the component tales were written down prior to 1450 from earlier oral forms which no longer exist.  Various linkages can be made between historical events and evidence from the 14th and 15th centuries and the society portrayed within the internal bounds of Gest, such as Robin's yeoman status as compared to other yeomen in the tales; which King Edward is referred to; references to changing feudal practices and the abuses of Late Medieval England; and the probable early audiences. Political and military events. In 2013, Joseph Taylor, aware of Ikegami's linguistic analysis, examined Gest as a northern text in the historical regional context of northern England.: 313  Northeast England has a history of political, cultural, and military separateness from southern England since the Heptarchy, when it was the Kingdom of Northumbria, which was later invaded and settled by the Vikings as the Kingdom of Jorvik. After the Norman Conquest, the Earl of Northumbria and the prince-bishops of the County Palatine of Durham were given political and military power second only to the King in London. The strategic geographic location of the northern counties was formally recognized in 1249 under a treaty which established the Scottish Marches as a buffer zone between Scotland and England. Each of the six Marches (three English and three Scottish) were controlled by their own Wardens. Many of the English East Wardens were appointed from powerful regional families, such as the Percies, the Nevilles, and the Cliffords. The border conflicts meant money and power to these regional families. As \"kings in the North\",: 316  they maintained private armies to control, as well as defend, England's border. The intermittent wars with Scotland also provided political leverage with the King in London, who fully realized that only the northern magnates could mobilize the necessary troops against Scotland — or against London.: 316–7 This sense of separateness is reflected in the Gest in the way London is portrayed as the power base for the villainous Abbot of St Mary's and Sheriff of Nottingham (see here).. Parliament's rise in importance during the 14th century also provided the Northern magnates with a legitimate means to restrict royal power within their counties.: 316–7 Social changes. the Hundred Years' War which was actually three phases of war separated by truces. ongoing clashes between the York and Lancaster dynasties over the throne of England; which attached the Duchy of Lancaster to the Crown under Henry IV, and the Duchy of York to the Crown under Edward IV. Following the Wars of the Roses, political power was finally consolidated under Henry VII.: 314 . social changes caused by the breakup of the English feudal systemOne important social change which occurred in response to the changes brought about by the climate, diseases, and military upheavals is the gradual change in the meaning of the term yeoman, which is used repeatedly in Gest. During the 14th and 15th centuries, between the time when the component tales were still in oral form and the time when Gest was compiled, the meaning of \"yeoman\" changed substantially.: 52-3  Originally, \"yeoman\" was a rank of noble household service as well as the chivalric rank between page and squire. By the late 14th century, it was also used to refer to freeborn and free tenure smallholders. During the 15th century, it began to refer to the growing social category (referred to as a \"middling sort\": 55 ), consisting of the now land-wealthy commoner landowners and the land-poor younger sons of nobility. (Primogeniture dictated that only the eldest son could inherit the family estates.) This self-identification was re-inforced by the 1413 Statute of Additions under Henry V, in which those paying the polltax had to specify their status and occupation. Eventually, \"yeoman\" expanded to include husbandmen who practiced a trade or craft to supplement their farming income.: 52-3  These shifts in meaning are evident in Gest when the component tales are considered separately from the narrative arc (see here). Yeoman in Gest. Richard Almond and A. J. Pollard did a study of the earliest Robin Hood tales, including Gest, Robin Hood and the Monk, Robin Hood and the Potter, and Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne.  To address this spectrum of possible meanings of 'yeoman' over the centuries, they proposed that, within Gest, the 'yeoman' Robin Hood has to be studied (1) separately from the minor characters called \"yeoman\", and (2) separately from the 'yeoman' of the audience.: 56  They referred to this confusion in the various meanings of 'yeoman' as the \"slipperiness of social terminology\" in the 15th century.: 75   Their main source, Peter Coss, also considered another confusion factor, that Gest was compiled from multiple source tales.: 71   Some historical clues found within Gest and the possible source tales, and the changing meanings of 'yeoman', are below. Robin as yeoman of the forest?. Almond and Pollard credited J. C. Holt with being the first historian to recognize the connection between a yeoman and the forest.: 57  Based upon clues within the text, Almond and Pollard extended Holt's idea, and proposed that audiences of the 15th century would have recognized Robin Hood as being a forester of Barnsdale or Sherwood because of these clues:: 56-8 . use of the phrase 'yeoman of the forest'. The phrase appears in the Fourth Fytte: lines 881-884 , and again in the Seventh Fytte: lines 1505-1508 . The former scene is when the Chief Steward insults Robin Hood by calling him a thief, to which Little John retorts that Robin is a 'yeoman of the forest'. The latter scene is when Robin Hood stops the disguised king, and introduces himself and his men as 'yeomen of the forest', now forced to dine on the King's deer. Almond and Pollard propose that the importance which appears to be attached to the phrase in these scenes indicate that Robin and his fellowship are more than mere outlaws taking refuge in the greenwood.: 58-9 Robin 'walking' in the forest. In the Sixth Fytte: lines 1313-1316 , Robin is described as walking in the forest, much to the chagrin of the Sheriff. Almond and Pollard suggest that \"walking\" should be interpreted in the sense of walking associated with an occupation, such as a \"police officer walking his beat\" meaning a police officer patroling his assigned area.: 60  This interpretation is supported by : 19-20  who described the foresters as sworn to protect the \"vert and venison\" within their assigned areas, which were known as divisions, wards, bailiwicks, or walks.. This phrase occurs after Robin and his men leave Sir Richard's castle, and before the Sheriff captures Sir Richard. It may be a part of a transition between fragments of two separate tales.. other 'good yeomen' who 'walk'. In the First Fytte, Robin forbids his men to waylay \"good yeoman/That walketh by green wood shawe [thicket]\".: lines 53-54  Almond and Pollard suggest that here Robin is referring to the other forest officials who were also yeomen: verderer, woodward, ranger, or agister.: 60 only a 'proud forester' can catch Robin. In the Seventh Fytte: lines 1465-1480  only a \"proud forester\" in royal service knows how to track Robin down. And that was by disguising the King as an abbot and five of his bodyguards as monks; in other words, it takes a forester to catch a forester.: 61  It is unknown if this opening fragment is from a now-lost tale or part of the Gest poet's transition between the Sixth and Seventh Fyttes. Robin's knowledge of royal hunt rituals. Almond and Pollard have traced some of the hunting rituals and terminology found in Gest back to The Master of Game, a hunting book translated in 1413 from French by Edward, Duke of York.: 64-66  They point out that in all the English-language 15th-century hunting literature, 'yeoman' is used consistently to refer to the hunt and forest officials.: 65 \"Bow and stable\" was the hunting technique in which herds of deer are driven by foresters and professional huntsmen towards the stationary noble hunters. The tryst tree is where the noble huntsman stood, with his bowbearer and his hound handlers, to await the deer being flushed toward them. Sometimes a lodge or hut made of green boughs would be built at the tryst for shelter as well as camouflage.: 64-66 . Almond and Pollard compare the 'royal' dinner prepared by Robin for the disguised King in the Seventh Fytte: lines 1545-1576  to that described in The Master of Game. Believing the abbot to be the King's emissary since he carries the Privy Seal, Robin invites him to a royal hunt. Robin escorts his honored guest by the hand (as is required of the yeoman of the bow) to the tryst tree. There the deer are slain and ritually butchered (dyghtande is a northern England term for the ritual).: lines 1533-1576  The butchering is done by Robin himself for the disguised King, who was given the prime cuts of venison, along with bread and wine.: 66-9 In Gest, the huntsman's hut serves as the tryst tree for the dinners with the Knight in the First Fytte and the Chief Steward of St Mary's in the Fourth Fytte. The Knight is given swan and pheasant, a noble's repast, but also the numbles, which was traditionally reserved for the foresters and the huntsmen.: 68-9 This royal (or noble) hunt familiarity may indicate that the Gest poet was a member of either a royal or noble household. Or it may indicate that hunting tales were part of his repertoire. Or both. Coss proposes that the Gest poet had a fairly large body of source material from which to choose. And since he chose to weave his sources together, rather than lay them end-to-end, it is difficult to untangle the now-lost tales which he used.: 71-2 Comparison with Chaucer's yeoman. Almond and Pollard also credited J. C. Holt as the first historian to notice the resemblance between Robin Hood and Geoffrey Chaucer's The Knight's Yeoman in The Canterbury Tales.: 62-3  But Holt never realized the significance of the Yeoman's accoutrements: his green coat and hood, his bow and arrows; his buckler and sword; and his horn attached to a green baldric. All of which indicated the Yeoman was a forester and huntsman; a position with which Chaucer was certainly familiar. He served as forester of North Petherton Park in Somersetshire for the last decade of his life.: xl The green livery of the forester and huntsman is depicted in many of the miniatures of the Livre de chasse, written by Gaston III, Count of Foix, in the late 14th century.: 63 Minor yeoman characters. Much, the Miller's son, and Will Scarlock, are both described as yeomen in the First Fytte, as they stand on the Saylis looking for Robin's guest.: line 78  When combined with Robin's description of his men as 'yeomen of the forest' in the Seventh Fytte, the implication is that they are both foresters.(See above.). In the Second Fytte, the young men participating in the wrestling match are described as yeomen.: lines 539-540  But since no details are given, the exact meaning is uncertain.: 74 . In the Third Fytte, Robin welcomes Little John back to the greenwood, and refers to the Sheriff's cook as a \"fair yeoman\".: line 709  Robin probably recognized the cook's clothing as being from the Sheriff's household. 'Yeoman' was a service rank in the household kitchen.: 74 . In the Eighth Fytte, the townspeople of Nottingham are called \"both yeomen and knaves\".: line 1714  Here 'yeomen' refers to the tradesmen,: 74  and knaves refers to the common laborers.: sense 3 . In the First Fytte, Little John is introduced as a \"good yeoman\" standing next to Robin.: line 12  Throughout Gest, Little John refers to Robin as his master.: lines 19, 41, 99, 101-2, 277, 281, 297, 705, 825, 881-2  He also demonstrates a courtesy equal to that of Robin's in his interactions with the Sorrowful Knight: lines 93-4  and the disguised King.: line 1568   Robin later offers Little John's service to the Sorrowful Knight as knave, who can serve as a yeoman in time of need.: lines 322-323  Here the meaning of 'knave' is an attendant,: sense 2  and 'yeoman' refers to the military (chivalric) rank.: sense 1  Later on, in the Third Fytte, Little John, in the guise of Reynold Greenleaf the knave, infiltrates the Sheriff's household in order to wreak vengeance on the Sheriff.: lines 611-16 Which King Edward?. Almond and Pollard's approach coincides neatly with the results of Thomas Ohlgren's study of 'which' King Edward is meant in Gest. Ohlgren asserts that the individual tales were composed during the early decades of the reign of Edward III (r 1327–1377). He bases his assertion on internal evidence (references made in the text) concerning feudalism, livery and maintenance, and other details that can be traced back to Edward III's reign.: 2  Ohlgren proposes that Gest was compiled from these individual tales during the reign of Henry V (1413–1422) or Henry VI (first reign 1422–1461).: 2  He uses the example of the 14th-century political poems of Lauence Minot, whose poems were recopied during Henry V's reign to celebrate Henry's victories in France. Similarly, some of the Robin Hood tales which referred to Edward III could have been compiled as Gest. Ohlgren argues that cultural references made in the original tales would only be understood by an audience who was no more than two or three generations later than Edward III.: 26-8  To support his assertion, Ohlgren considers clues which can be found within the text of Gest. \"Edward our comely King\": line 1412 . The king is referred to as \"Edward, our comely king\". But which King Edward is it? The epithet is the first clue. Olhgren recently discovered a similar epithet in the political poetry written by Laurence Minot in the 14th century. Minot composed poems in Middle English celebrating the victories of Edward III, including those against the Scots (Battle of Halidon Hill in 1333) and against the French (Siege of Guînes (1352)). They were probably written not long after the events, but eleven of his political poems were revised c. 1352 to form a continuous narrative. They were popular enough to have been recopied during the reign of Henry V or Henry VI (our earliest surviving text is dated to 1425-50).: ?  Minot's poem IV begins: Ohlgren considered this significant, as only two works are known to use the phrase \"Edward our comely king\": Minot's poem IV and Gest. By itself, this evidence is not convincing; but the other three clues, which are inter-related, add weight to his argument.. \"far beyond the sea/In England right\": lines 353-54 . In the Second Fytte, the greedy Abbot is gloating that this is the Knight's last day to repay his debt, then his lands will be forfeit. The kind-hearted Prior rebukes the Abbot: \"Far beyond the sea\" has been usually interpreted as the Knight being on crusade or a pilgrimage: 192-93 , but Ohlgren considers it to mean that the Knight was fighting in France at the beginning of the Hundred Years War. \"In England right\" was the rallying cry for Edward III's legal claim to certain territories in France - and to the French throne. The phrase appears 4 times in Minot's poems, and it always refers to Edward's legal claim.: 8-9 : poem I, line 31 : poem III, lines 5-7 : poem IV, lines 49-51 : poem VIII, lines 36-7 \"Saint Quentin\": line 1258 . In the Fifth Fytte, Sir Richard at the Lee shelters Robin and his fellowship from the Sheriff's posse comitatus: Sir Richard swears by Saint Quentin to house Robin for forty days. Saint Quentin was a 3rd-century Christian martyr whose pilgrimage cult at the Basilica of Saint-Quentin in Saint-Quentin, Aisne flourished during the Middle Ages. Saint-Quentin is not far from Thiérache, site of the first encounter between Edward III and Philip VI of France during the chevauchée of 1339.. Possible source tales for the Seventh Fytte. Ohlgren draws attention to two tales which are considered part of the \"King and Subject\" tradition as described by Child: King Edward and Shepherd (hereafter called Shepherd) and King and Hermit (hereafter called Hermit). Both tales were mentioned by Child as part of his discussion of King Edward the Fourth and a Tanner of Tamworth (#273).[Child, V, p ??] Curiously, Child included Tanner, which survives as a 17th-century text, but he does not include either Shepherd or Hermit, both of which survive as incomplete manuscripts dated c. 1450. In Olgren's study of the two tales, he has concluded that there is nothing \"to preclude their having been used as the sources for the 'King and the Subject' theme in Gest.\": 12 . Shepherd is preserved as part of the same manuscript which contains Robin Hood and the Monk. Shepherd unambiguously describes Edward III as the King:: 10 born at Windsor Castle. father was a Welsh knight; mother was named Isabella. his steward is Ralph Stafford, 1st Earl of Stafford. Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster, and John de Warenne, 7th Earl of Surrey, are mentioned. \"Hermit\" is preserved .... Shepherd and Hermit share plot similarities: a disguised king who seeks out his subjects to listen to their complaints; he dines on what turns out to be a dinner consisting of poached venison and fowl; the subject engages the king in a drinking game; the king invites the subject to court, where the king's true identity is revealed.: 10  Both tales contain interesting plot details which parallel Gest:: 11 In Shepherd, a hand-washing ritual occurs prior to the feast at court; in Gest the ritual occurs prior to Robin's meals with the Knight and with the Monk.. The first meal provided by the Shepherd to the King is similar to that provided by Robin to the Knight.. The second meal provided by the Shepherd to his King is similar to the meal provided by Robin to his King.. In Hermit, the King is lured into the forest by the promise of a great-headed deer. The incident occurs five miles from Nottingham. In Gest, this is similar to Little John's ruse to lure the Sheriff into the greenwood, in which Little John runs five miles to the Sheriff's hunting party with news of a great green hart.Cultural memory of Edward III. Shepherd and Hermit, as well as the political poems of Minot, are examples of a cultural memory of Edward III which still existed some three or four generations after his death. (This cultural memory may have been encouraged by Henry IV, a grandson of Edward III, who had usurped the throne from Richard II, son of Edward the Black Prince, in 1399.) Edward was remembered as having concern for his subjects, and was committed to redressing injustices committed by his officials.: 12 . Another popular text was the \"De reginine principum\", which was translated (1411-12) into Middle English by Privy Seal clerk Thomas Hoccleve as the Regiment of Princes. Hoccleve addressed his poem to Henry of Monmouth, Prince of Wales and Duke of Lancaster (the future Henry V). Henry IV was in poor health, and his son had taken over the reins of government in 1410. In the Regiment of Princes, Hoccleve included many references to Edward's personal life and events of his time. Hoccleve advices Henry to personally find out what his subjects think of him in the section \"Of Justice\". Like \"Edward the last\", Henry should travel among his subjects \"in simple array alone\" \"To hear what men said of thy person\" (modern spelling).: 12  The King is obligated to help them. If his officials are oppressing the people, he is to redress the wrongs done. Sir Richard as army recruiter?. Ohlgren draws attention to the Knight's activities during the year before his 400-pound debt repayment is due to Robin Hood in the Second Fytte. The Knight's income from his lands is only 400 pounds, so how is he paying for the men and equipment?. Ohlgren proposes that the money could have come from two sources: indenture and purveyance.: 5-8  Indenture was started by Edward I as a way of supplementing the number of troops raised through the feudal (tenure) levies, but it became almost standard practice under Edward III, who used it to recruit the rank and file of his armies.[1954_Lyon, p 503-4] In the 14th and 15th centuries, purveyance[MED, sense 3, 4] meant recruiting men, clothing them, furnishing the equipment for a campaign, and providing food and transportation for them to the English coast. The 100 men-at-arms mentioned in the text don't seem to have been the Knight's personal retinue, the uniforms being red and white. These colors belonged to Richard Fitzalan, 3rd Earl of Arundel, who served in almost all of Edward III's French campaigns. Recruiting and outfitting these men could have earned the Knight between 250 and 650 pounds.: 7 Livery and fees. Livery originally referred to a lord providing food and clothing to his household servants. It later expanded to refer to the distinctive uniform worn by the lord's servants. Under the original English feudalism as imported by the Normans, a tenant-in-chief's feudal obligations to the king were originally defined by tenure. Those who accepted lands from the king were expected to return specified services at his command, such as fealty, suit of court, and military service. The latter was known as knight's service. The English invasions of Scotland during the reign of Edward I demanded more men-at-arms and archers than the traditional feudal methods could supply. This situation became even more acute under his grandson Edward III at the beginning of the Hundred Years War. Indentures were drawn up between the king and his lords, and between the lords and their sub-tenants or captains of men, for the provision of a certain number of men-at-arms and archers. These men were equipped with weapons and furnished with distinctive clothing or badges as a means of identification.Under a strong king, such as Edward III, the increased power of regional magnates afforded by this practice could be restrained, but under a weak king, such as Richard II, abuses became rampant. In 1377, 1384, and 1388, Parliament protested against the abuses, now referred to as livery and maintenance. Parliament was concerned about the increasing number of liveried retainers involved in violence and riots who expected to escape legal retribution through the sheriffs and justices of the peace who could be retained by their lord.Throughout Gest, there are several references to the expanded use of livery and fees during the 14th and 15th centuries.. The following incidents indicate that Robin bestowed liveries upon his men (or at least provided the cloth). As mentioned above, this was considered acceptable practice during wartime under the terms of the indentures with Robin, who is considered a yeoman leader, or captain, of men.: 17 . Robin Hood and the Knight. In the First Fytte, Robin Hood agrees to provide livery to the threadbare Knight. Little John then measures out a generous three yards of scarlet and raye (striped)[MED_raye] cloth, which he hands over to the Knight.: lines 276-296 Little John and the Cook. In the Third Fytte, on Robin's behalf, Little John offers to the Cook twenty marks and two sets of clothing per year as incentive to join Robin's fellowship.: lines 676-682 Robin and King Edward. In the Eighth Fytte, King Edward asks to purchase from Robin green cloth to replace their gray monk's robes.: lines 1669-1676 Robin at Edward's court. In the Eighth Fytte, Robin has spent all his wealth on fees for his men.: lines 1729-1736 Sheriff and Little John. In the Third Fytte, the Sheriff offers to retain Little John as a member of his household for 20 marks per year.: lines 597-600 However, the most prominent incident is the illegal practice of 'cloth and fee' described in the Second Fytte. 'Cloth and fee' (another name for livery and fee) refers to the payment of money and gifts of clothing to the King's justice in return for favorable legal services.: line 426 Note  This practice became so prevalent that, in 1346, Edward III issued a statute requiring his justices to swear an oath that they would only accept 'cloth and fee' from the King himself.: line 425 Note, line 426 Note  In this episode, the Abbot is trying to defraud the Knight of his land, so he retains a County Justice, the King's officer, to force the issue in the Abbot's favor.: lines 371-372, 425-426  Once the Abbot has publicly insulted the Knight, the Chief Justice seeks to defuse the situation by suggesting the Abbot offer to purchase the land outright.: lines 465-66, 465 Note  The ridiculously low price offered by the Abbot is yet another insult to the Knight, which prompts the Knight to empty the bag of Robin's 400 pounds onto the Abbot's table. The Knight then declares to all present to bear witness to the fact that he has redeemed his land legally. Peasants' revolt of 1381. Most of the initial historical interpretations placing Gest during the 14th century were based upon a misreading of Child's discussion of a possible date of composition for Gest. Child placed his conclusion (\"There are no firm grounds on which to base an opinion.\") at the end of a lengthy discussion in which he unsuccessfully attempted to date Gest to 1400 or earlier.: 40  Based upon this misreading, for the next century scholars continued to propose that since Piers Plowman is connected with the Peasants' revolt, and since the priest Sloth mentions \"rymes of Robyn Hode\", then Robin Hood is also connected. However, Langland gives no indication as to what these rhymes are, and there are no surviving rhymes from Langland's lifetime.. According to Richard Almond and A. J. Pollard: 55-6 , the association between Robin Hood and the issues of the Peasants' Revolt was first made by Rodney Hilton in 1958, when he described Robin Hood as \"a free peasant representing peasant ideology for a peasant audience\".: 55  However, in 1961, J. C. Holt rebutted Hilton, asserting that the Robin Hood tales were composed in castle and manor halls, a position Holt expanded upon in his book. Since then, a consensus has emerged that Robin Hood represented a new social group above the peasants and below those who bore a coat of arms, a group which is often referred to as the \"middling sort\".: 56   Gest does not appear to be concerned with peasants' issues, and is not particularly similar in themes with surviving songs of the peasantry.: 37-38 Forest law and poaching. In Gest, several references to Robin Hood's fellowship poaching the King's deer are mentioned as passing remarks.  They are not further developed, however, and do not appear to be a core part of the early Robin Hood legend. Mentions include: when itemizing the Knight's dinner menu in the First Fytte: lines 127-132 , and the King's dinner menu in the Seventh Fytte: lines 1569-1572 . in the transition between the Sixth and Seventh Fyttes, the Gest poet speaks of how King Edward travelled throughout Lancashire, without seeing the usual large herds of deer: lines 1425-1432 . when Robin Hood accosts the disguised King Edward in the Seventh Fytte: lines 1507-1508 As a ballad. Gest was included by Francis Child as part of his influential collection of ballads, the Child Ballads, as number 117 in volume 3 of his collection The English and Scottish Popular Ballads.  He had earlier published a version in 1859.  Its quatrain structure and rhyme scheme fits with other Middle English ballads.  However, Gest, along with other traditional border ballads of the Anglo-Scottish border and ballads of Robin Hood, has its own distinctions from other Child ballads. They are narratives, which generally lack a chorus or refrain, and appear to have been composed as recitations before an audience. Only Gest is considered comparable to the Danish and English heroic ballads, the epic poem Beowulf, and the great Middle English romances - Havelok the Dane and The Tale of Gamelyn.In the Roud Folk Song Index, Gest is listed as number 70. Rhyme and rhythm schemes. Thus begins the Gest; calling all free-born gentlemen to hear tales of the good yeoman Robyn Hode.  The lines within the quatrain have an ABCB rhyme scheme, in which the last words of lines 2 and 4 rhyme, but the last words of lines 1 and 3 may or may not. The words in each line also have a rhythm or beat due to the combinations of stressed and unstressed syllables. Lines 1 and 3 have four stressed syllables, while lines 2 and 4 have three stressed syllables. Each stressed syllable is preceded by one or two unstressed syllables. Another excerpt, which if read aloud has stressed syllables in bold font to demonstrate the intended rhythm: A musical interpretation of this vocal pattern was recorded in 2002 by Bob Frank in a modern English version entitled A Little Gest of Robin Hood. Frank accompanied himself with an acoustic guitar, while reciting the lines in a talking blues style. Fowler's reconstruction of narrative ballad history. As the Child Ballads were being prepared for publication, there was an ongoing debate among those who studied ballad origins. Those who considered that ballads originated as communal songs and dances were known as communalists; those who supported the opposing position, that ballads were written by individual authors, were known as individualists. This debate involved questions that have since been \"discarded as subjects for fruitful inquiry\". In other words, the question of communal versus individual origination can never be answered due to lack of historical evidence. The current consensus is that, since so little is known about the origins of the earliest ballads, their origins can only be deduced from clues within the texts themselves on a case-by-case basis. It was advocated by the English historian J R Maddicott in a series of articles in the journal Past & Present (1958–61) and re-iterated in 1978.: 233 In 1968, D. C. Fowler proposed a new reconstruction of the history of the narrative ballad, based upon his study of Gest, and the oldest Robin Hood ballads (Robin Hood and the Monk, and Robin Hood and the Potter). His proposal was that the narrative ballad is a subcategory of folksong that uses a narrative form. The narrative ballad, as it appeared in England during the 15th–16th centuries, was a result of the merger of several different traditions. The first tradition was folksong, which appeared about the 12th century, and became more widespread during the 13th–15th centuries with the appearance of carols and religious songs sung in the vernacular. The second tradition was itself the result of a 14th-century blending of the 12th century French courtly romances (such as the Arthurian romances) with the Old English alliterative traditional poetry to form a new genre of English metrical narrative romance (such as those included in the Ancient Engleish Metrical Romanceës).: 5-10  These romances are usually associated with royal court minstrels, but minstrels were also present at the great baronial halls of the north of England.: 8  These powerful barons, such as the House of Percy, the House of Neville, and the York and Lancaster cadet branches of the Plantagenet dynasty, maintained courts which rivalled the Royal Court in London.. Fowler's proposal was both opposed and applauded for his attempt to construct a history of ballads based upon the earliest dates of surviving texts and not upon comparative structure and form. Independent support for minstrel origins was offered by several historians. Maurice Keen, in his first edition (1961) of The Outlaws of Medieval Legend argued that the ballad form of the Robin Hood stories indicated a primitive popular origin. In the Introduction to his second edition (1977), Keen stated that criticism forced him to abandon his original arguments  He now supported the position that the narrative ballads were minstrel compositions.  In 1989, James Holt also advocated a minstrel origin for the Robin Hood ballads when he proposed that the original audience was the yeoman servants of the English feudal households, especially those of Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, a grandson of Henry III. Holt proposed the ballads were then spread from the great halls to market-places, taverns and inns, where the common people heard them.: 12 Sung or recited?. Fowler contended that the Robin Hood ballads were distinct from \"true\" ballads because they were recited, not sung.: 5-10  His evidence is twofold: (1) unrelated manuscripts, approximately from the same time at which Gest may have been compiled, which mention Robin Hood, and (2) internal passages from Gest and the two oldest Robin Hood ballads in manuscript form which are approximately contemporaneous with Gest: Robin Hood and the Monk, and Robin Hood and the Potter.: 65-67 This interpretation of the contemporary manuscripts was originally proposed by Chambers, which Fowler incorporated into his hypothesis. The importance of the manuscripts is not only that they mentioned Robin Hood, but also what they said about him. The manuscripts are:: 65-71 . Dives and Pauper (dated to ca 1410) refers to \"tale or a song of robyn hode\"According to Fowler, the use of the words sing or song refers, not to the melodic singing of a folksong, but to a type of chanting known as plainsong. This view can be supported by one of the meanings of the Middle English singen (\"to sing\"): to relate a story in song or verse; to recite a poem.Scotichronicon (dated to ca 1450), written by Bower in Latin, uses the phrases \"cantitare delectantur\" and \"recitantur\" in its mention of Robin Hood and Little John in the then-popular \"romanciis, mimos, ei bardanos\"                    cantitare delectantur     loosely translated as \"delightful singing\" or                                                         as \"delightful recitation\": cantare, senses 1,5 : delectantia                     recitantur                      means as \"reading aloud\": recitare, sense 1                     romanciis                      means \"narratives, stories, or historical accounts\": romancia                     mimos                           means \"mimic plays\": mimologus . In other words, Bower is talking about delightful stories about Robin Hood which are being performed in song and/or recitation.Historia Majoris Britanniae (dated 1521), written by Mair in Latin, contains a remark that the exploits of Robin Hood are known throughout England in \"cantibus\"                    cantibus                           means \"a singing tone in the delivery of an orator\": canticum, sense II.B . Perhaps \"a singing tone\" is not descriptive enough; it is rhythm, cadance, and word choice that makes a great orator. Churchill's second and third speeches delivered during the Battle of France, as well as Franklin Roosevelt's first inaugural address and Day of infamy address are examples from two of the masters of the radio address.The internal evidence offered by Fowler consists of passages within the three ballads:: 65-67 . the use of speech verbs, such as speak, talk, and tell:. Robin Hood and the Potter contains the line \"Now speak we of Roben Hode\": line 308 . Robin Hood and the Monk ends with the line \"Thus ends the talking of the monk/And Robyn Hode ...\": lines 355-6 . the opening stanza of Gest contains \"I shall you tell of a good yeoman,\" : line 3 . the use of transitions. between Fyttes 1 and 2 : lines 325-36 . at the beginning of Fytte 4 : lines 817-20 . between the end of the Monk tale and resumption of the Sorrowful Knight tale in Fytte 4 : lines 1041–44 . the use of frequent asides to the audienceThe most compelling internal evidence is the repeated use of the \"Lythe and listen\" formulaic.: 65-67  It is found: at the beginning of Fyttes 1, 3, 6: lines 1, 573, 1265 . in the second stanza of Fytte 5: line 1125 \"lythe\" comes from Old Norse[U of MI's MED]. When used in the phrase \"lythe and listen\" it means \"to hear, to be attentive\" (as in the colloquialism \"listen up!\"). The Gest poet uses this formulaic whenever a new tale is about to begin. Considering the length of the ballad, it is possible that the ballad was broken up into sections for performance; and the \"Lythe and listen\" would alert the audience that the performance was about to resume. Classification of Gest and other Robin Hood ballads. Scholars have discussed how best to classify Gest: is it a ballad, a poem, an epic or epic poem, a combination, a romance, or something else?  Both Francis James Child and his successor George Lyman Kittredge gathered about themselves a group of students to continue the study of the Child ballads. Francis Barton Gummere was a student who assisted Child in compiling the ballads. Gummere later wrote two books which were based upon their collaboration: Old English Ballads and The Popular Ballad. In the latter book, Gummere described a classification scheme based upon the ballad structure and form.. Two other students of Kittredge expanded upon Gummere's classification scheme. Walter Morris Hart studied under Kittredge and later wrote Ballad and Epic. A Study in the Development of the Narrative Art. Hart examined ballads from each of Gummere's classes, and compared Gest to Beowulf and the Song of Roland.: 354-5  Hart looked more closely at the levels of elaboration and accretion, among ballads of the same class and between ballads of different classes. Elaboration (defined by Hart as growth from within): 355  describes the differences in choral ballads and narrative ballads. As the narrative becomes more important, the characterisations, the surroundings, and the inter-relationships become more detailed. This increased level of detail allows for a more nuanced portrait of an individual's character, motives, and an understanding of their state of mind. Accretion (defined by Hart as the accumulation of independent events): 355  is the complexity which arises in the narrative as the central character becomes a heroic figure, and represents the community's ideals.: 354-5  On the basis of its elaboration and accretion, Hart judged Gest as \"an epic in the making\".: 347  In Hart's opinion, Gest is surpassed only by the Danish and English heroic ballads, and Beowulf and Roland.: 357–8 William Hall Clawson wrote his doctoral thesis on the Robin Hood ballads, which was later published as The Gest of Robin Hood. Prior to its publication, Clawson wrote an article, Ballad and Epic, which summarized his synthesis of the work done by Gummere and Hart.  In 1974, J. B. Bessinger Jr., contending that the term \"epic\" was confusing, called Gest \"a minor heroic poem\" on the basis of his comparison of Gest with Havelok the Dane and The Tale of Gamelyn.  Extending his comparison to the themes and content of Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, Bessinger concluded that Gest lies somewhere between a ballad, epic, and a romance. Scholarship. Various scholars have written on Gest.  The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, by Francis James Child, was very influential and popular in spreading knowledge of the oldest surviving ballads in English literature, although more evidence has been discovered since the late 1880s that Child did not have access to at the time.  William Hall Clawson wrote extensively on Gest in 1909.  Medievalist D. C. Fowler published A Literary History of the Popular Ballad in 1968. In 1989, two historians, Barrie Dobson and John Taylor, wrote \"Rymes of Robyn Hood\" on the subject. In 1997, Stephen Knight and Thomas H. Ohlgren published Robin Hood and Other Outlaw Tales, a collection of all the pre-17th-century tales of Robin Hood, arranged in chronological order. Their book now forms the core of the Robin Hood Project of the University of Rochester's Middle English Texts website. In 2013 Ohlgren and linguist Lister M. Matheson published Early Rymes of Robin Hood, which includes \"as-is\" transcriptions of all the earliest surviving copies of Gest for use by scholars. Adaptations. Among early ballads, Robin Hood's Death is likely the most related, being a longer telling of the same story as the final six stanzas of Gest.  Whether Death was an expansion of Gest, Gest an abridgment of Death, or both were based on a lost common source is impossible to say.Various motifs in Gest reoccur in both contemporaneous ballads and later ones.  Robin Hood robs a cleric in both Robin Hood and the Bishop and Robin Hood and the Bishop of Hereford; interacts with the king in a mostly friendly fashion in The King's Disguise, and Friendship with Robin Hood and many later stories; and gets involved in archery contests constantly.With the rise of English Romanticism in the late 18th century came a resurgence in the popularity of the Robin Hood ballads. Gest was reprinted several times as part of various anthologies, the first of which was Robin Hood: A collection of all the Ancient Poems Songs and Ballads now extant, relative to that celebrated Outlaw, edited by Joseph Ritson in 1795 (followed by later editions in 1820, 1832 and 1885).  Ivanhoe by Walter Scott was greatly influenced by Ritson's collection and likely an inspiration for the character of Locksley in it.  Echoes from Gest can be found throughout Ivanhoe: in its various locations in the West Riding of Yorkshire; in the use of elements of Gest in key scenes at the Tournament of Ashby; and in Scott's re-use of the Gest poet's feasting scene motif to highlight important plot twists.. Gest has influenced modern versions of the Robin Hood tales, especially in the basic plot motifs such as Robin robbing someone and sharing the loot with another who is more worthy.  However, its main stories are not always seen as much as the other Robin Hood ballads, most notably the story of The Sorrowful Knight. The adaption which bears obvious traces is the popular children's book written by Howard Pyle in 1883. Pyle's book was a huge influence on how Hollywood would later portray Robin Hood. Howard Pyle's Merry Adventures. Howard Pyle's contribution to the Robin Hood revival of the 19th century was his richly illustrated children's book The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood. Following in the footsteps of Walter Scott, Pyle had Robin Hood roaming Sherwood Forest (not Barnsdale) during the reign of King Richard the Lionheart (not comely King Edward).  Pyle did adapt the tale of the Sorrowful Knight, perhaps the most unique tale of Gest, in Chapters I-II of Part the Fifth of his work.: 157-184   The story is heavily modified from that in Gest (Pyle replaced most of Fytte 1 with his own version of how the Knight received his money; not from Robin, but from the Bishop of Hereford, who \"conveniently\" came to Robin's feast). Writing in an era of it being cheap to write in longform, Pyle extended the story with richly detailed descriptions and drawings, while the compiler of Gest, needing to make something short and punchy enough to potentially be recited by a minstrel, was more spare in his prose. Pyle also includes the episode of the wrestling yeoman, but to tie it more clearly into the novel, he made the man David of Doncaster, a Merry Man from Robin Hood and the Golden Arrow, though even this made the episode odd among Pyle's novelistic effects. .
